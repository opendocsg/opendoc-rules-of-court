>>(iv) where the application is made under the second Act, that at the date of the application the judgment can be enforced by execution in the country of the original court and that, if it were registered, the registration would not be, or be liable to be, set aside under section 5 of that Act; and

(2)  [_Deleted by S 278/93_]



(3)  Where a judgment sought to be registered under the second Act is in respect of different matters, and some, but not all, of the provisions of the judgment are such that if those provisions had been contained in separate judgments, those judgments could properly have been registered, the affidavit must state the provisions in respect of which it is sought to register the judgment.



(4)  In the case of an application under the second Act, the affidavit must be accompanied by such other evidence with respect to the enforceability of the judgment by execution in the country of the original court, and of the law of that country under which any interest has become due under the judgment, as may be required having regard to the provisions of the Order under the Act extending that Act to that country.

## Security for costs (O. 67, r. 4)

**4.**  Except as otherwise provided by any notification made under section 5 of the first Act or any relevant Order under the second Act, the Court may order the judgment creditor to give security for the costs of the application for registration and of any proceedings which may be brought to set aside the registration.

## Order for registration (O. 67, r. 5)

**5.**—(1)  An order in Form 148 giving leave to register a judgment must be drawn up by, or on behalf of, the judgment creditor and served on the judgment debtor.



(2)  Every such order shall state the period within which an application may be made to set aside the registration and shall contain a notification that execution on the judgment will not issue until after the expiration of that period.



(3)  The Court may, on an application made at any time while it remains competent for any party to apply to have the registration set aside, extend the period (either as originally fixed or as subsequently extended) within which an application to have the registration set aside may be made.

## Register of judgments (O. 67, r. 6)

**6.**—(1)  There shall be kept in the Registry a register of the judgments ordered to be registered under the first and the second Acts.

(3)  The notice of registration must state —

## Endorsement of service (O. 67, r. 8)

(2)  The Court hearing such application may order any issue between the judgment creditor and the judgment debtor to be tried in any manner in which an issue in an action may be ordered to be tried.



(3)  Where the Court hearing an application to set aside the registration of a judgment registered under the first Act is satisfied that the judgment falls within any of the cases in which a judgment may not be ordered to be registered under section 3(2) of that Act or that it is not just or convenient that the judgment should be enforced in Singapore or that there is some other sufficient reason for setting aside the registration, it may order the registration of the judgment to be set aside on such terms as it thinks fit.

## Issue of execution (O. 67, r. 10)

**10.**—(1)  Execution shall not issue on a judgment registered under the first Act or second Act until after the expiration of the period which, in accordance with Rule 5(2), is specified in the order for registration as the period within which an application may be made to set aside the registration or, if that period has been extended by the Court, until after the expiration of that period as so extended.
