## Manner of carrying out sale (O. 31, r. 2)

**2.**—(1)  Where an order is made, whether in Court or in Chambers, directing any immovable property to be sold, the Court may permit the party or person having the conduct of the sale to sell the property in such manner as he thinks fit, or may direct that the property be sold in such manner as the Court may either by the order or subsequently direct for the best price that can be obtained, and all proper parties shall join in the sale and conveyance as the Court shall direct.



(2)  The Court may give such directions as it thinks fit for the purpose of effecting the sale, including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words, directions —

>(_a_) appointing the party or person who is to have the conduct of the sale;

>(_d_) requiring payment of the purchase money into Court or to trustees or other persons;

>(_e_) for settling the particulars and conditions of sale;

>(_f_) for obtaining evidence of the value of the property;
