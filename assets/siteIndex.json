(2)  A defendant may, without the leave of the Court — (a) withdraw his defence or any part of it at any time; or (b) discontinue a counterclaim, or withdraw any particular claim made by him therein, as against all or any of the parties against whom it is made, at any time not later than 14 days after service on him of a defence to counterclaim or, if the counterclaim is made against 2 or more parties, of the defence to counterclaim last served, by serving a notice in Form 30 to that effect on the plaintiff or other party concerned. (3)  Where there are 2 or more defendants to an action not all of whom serve a defence on the plaintiff, and the period fixed under these Rules for service by any of those defendants of his defence expires after the latest date on which any other defendant serves his defence, paragraph (1) shall have effect as if the reference therein to the service of the defence last served were a reference to the expiration of that period.

(4)  If all the parties to an action consent, the action may be withdrawn without the leave of the Court at any time before trial by producing to the Registrar a written consent to the action being withdrawn signed by all the parties. (5)  An action begun by writ is deemed to have been discontinued against a defendant if the memorandum of service referred to in Order 10, Rule 1(4) is not filed in respect of the service of the writ on that defendant within 12 months after the validity of the writ for the purpose of service has expired, and, within that time — (a) a memorandum of appearance has not been filed in the action by that defendant; and (b) judgment has not been obtained in the action against that defendant in respect of the whole or any part of the relief claimed against that defendant in the action. (6)  Subject to paragraph (6A), if no party to an action or a cause or matter has, for more than one year (or such extended period as the Court may allow under paragraph (6B)), taken any step or proceeding in the action, cause or matter that appears from records maintained by the Court, the action, cause or matter is deemed to have been discontinued. (6A)  Paragraph (6) shall not apply where the action, cause or matter has been stayed pursuant to an order of court. (6B)  The Court may, on an application by any party made before the one year referred to in paragraph (6) has elapsed, extend the time to such extent as it may think fit. (7)  Paragraph (6) shall apply to an action, a cause or a matter, whether it commenced before, on or after 15th December 1999, but where the last proceeding in the action, cause or matter took place before 1st January 2000, the period of one year shall only begin on 1st January 2000.

(2)  On making any payment into Court under this Rule, and on increasing any such payment already made, the defendant must give notice thereof in Form 31 to the plaintiff and every other defendant (if any); and within 3 days after receiving the notice the plaintiff must send the defendant a written acknowledgment of its receipt.

(5)  Where a single sum of money is paid into Court under this Rule in respect of 2 or more causes of action, then, if it appears to the Court that the plaintiff is embarrassed by the payment, the Court may, subject to paragraph (6), order the defendant to amend the notice of payment so as to specify the sum paid in respect of each cause of action. (6)  Where a cause of action under section 10 of the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43) and a cause of action under section 20 of that Act are joined in an action, with or without any other cause of action, the causes of action under those sections shall, for the purpose of paragraph (5), be treated as one cause of action.

"text": "Preparation of Cases (O. 57, r. 9A) 9A.—(1)  The appellant must file his Case (referred to in this Order as the Appellant’s Case) within the time specified in Rule 9. (2)  The respondent must file his Case (referred to in this Order as the Respondent’s Case) — (a) within one month after service on him of the record of appeal, the Appellant’s Case and the core bundle; or (b) in the event a joint record of appeal is filed, within one month after service on him of the Appellant’s Case and the core bundle. (2A)  If the respondent intends to refer to any document in the Respondent’s Case or at the appeal, and such document is not included in the core bundle, the respondent shall file, at the same time as his case, a supplemental core bundle (called in this Order the Respondent’s supplemental core bundle) which shall contain — (a) such additional documents as are not included in the core bundle; and (b) an index of the documents included in the supplemental core bundle, which shall cross-refer each document to its location in the record of appeal or joint record of appeal, as the case may be. [S 474/2016 wef 01/10/2016] (3)  The form of the Case shall comply with the following requirements: (a) it shall consist of paragraphs numbered consecutively; (b) it shall state, as concisely as possible — (i) the circumstances out of which the appeal arises; (ii) the issues arising in the appeal; (iii) the contentions to be urged by the party filing it and the authorities in support thereof; and (iv) the reasons for or against the appeal, as the case may be; (c) it shall be in the same size and style as the record of appeal and the core bundles with alphabetical lettering in the left hand margin at every fifth line, the first letter “A” being placed against the first line in each page, and with references in the right hand margin to the relevant pages of the record of appeal, the core bundle and the Respondent’s supplemental core bundle (if any); and [S 474/2016 wef 01/10/2016] (d) care shall be taken to avoid, as far as possible, the recital of long extracts from the record of appeal or the core bundle. (4)  If a party — (a) is abandoning any point taken in the Court below; or (b) intends to apply in the course of the hearing for leave to introduce a new point not taken in the Court below, this should be stated clearly in the Case, and if the new point referred to in sub-paragraph (b) involves the introduction of fresh evidence, this should also be stated clearly in the Case and an application for leave must be made under Rule 16 to adduce the fresh evidence. (5)  A respondent who, not having appealed from the decision of the Court below, desires to contend on the appeal that the decision of that Court should be varied in the event of an appeal being allowed in whole or in part, or that the decision of that Court should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by that Court, must state so in his Case, specifying the grounds of that contention. (5A)  An appellant must file an Appellant’s Reply within 2 weeks after service on him of the Respondent’s Case where — (a) the respondent states in the Respondent’s Case that the decision of the Court below should be varied in the event of an appeal being allowed in whole or in part, or that the decision of that Court should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by that Court; and (b) the appellant disagrees with any of the grounds of contention of the respondent referred to in sub-paragraph (a) as stated in the Respondent’s Case. (5B)  The Appellant’s Reply shall be limited to addressing the issues referred to in paragraph (5A)(a) raised by the respondent in the Respondent’s Case. (5C)  If the appellant intends to refer to any document in the Appellant’s Reply or at the appeal, and that document is not included in either the core bundle or the Respondent’s supplemental core bundle, the appellant must file, at the same time as the Appellant’s Reply, a supplemental core bundle (called in this Order the Appellant’s supplemental core bundle) containing — (a) any additional documents that are not included in the core bundle and the Respondent’s supplemental core bundle; and (b) an index of the documents included in the Appellant’s supplemental core bundle, which cross-refers each such document to its location in the record of appeal or joint record of appeal (as the case may be). [S 474/2016 wef 01/10/2016] (5D)  Unless the context otherwise requires, this Rule and Rule 10 apply, with the necessary modifications, in relation to an Appellant’s Reply as they apply in relation to a Case. [S 474/2016 wef 01/10/2016] (6)  Except with the leave of the Court of Appeal, a respondent shall not be entitled on the hearing of the appeal — (a) to contend that the decision of the Court below should be varied upon grounds not specified in his Case; (b) to apply for any relief not so specified; or (c) to support the decision of the Court below upon any grounds not relied upon by that Court or specified in his Case. (7)  A Case may be amended at any time with the leave of the Court of Appeal. (8)  Except to such extent as may be necessary to the development of the argument, a Case need not set out or summarise the judgment of the Court below, nor set out statutory provisions, nor contain an account of the proceedings below or of the facts of the case. (9)  Every Case must conclude with a numbered summary of the reasons upon which the argument is founded, and must bear the name and signature of the solicitor who has prepared the Case or who will appear before the Court of Appeal. (10)  The solicitor of any party, in drafting a Case, should assume that it will be read in conjunction with the documents included in the core bundle and any supplemental core bundle. (11)  All the appellants may join in one Appellants’ Case, and all the respondents may similarly join in one Respondents’ Case. (12)  A party whose interest in the appeal is passive (such as a stake-holder, a trustee or an executor) is not required to file a separate Case but should ensure that his position is explained in one of the Cases filed. (13)  The filing of a joint Case on behalf of both appellant and respondent may be permitted in special circumstances. (14)  [Deleted by S 612/98] (15)  No Case need be filed in any interlocutory matter or application to be heard by the Court of Appeal but Cases must be filed in any appeal arising from any interlocutory order. (16)  A party to an appeal shall file together with his Case a bundle of authorities relied on by the Court below as well as other authorities to be relied on at the hearing of the appeal and serve such bundle of authorities on the other party. (17)  A respondent who fails to file his Case within the time specified in paragraph (2) may be heard only with the leave of the Court of Appeal and on such terms and conditions as the Court of Appeal may impose. (18)  Subject to paragraph (19), where 2 or more appeals arise from the same judgment or order below, an appellant or a respondent to one or more of the appeals may apply to a Judge of Appeal or, if one is not available, to a Judge (including the Judge hearing the proceedings in the Court below), for leave to file a single Case, record of appeal or core bundle covering all such appeals. [S 850/2014 wef 01/01/2015] (19)  Leave is not required under paragraph (18) if each party to each appeal consents to filing a single Case, record of appeal or core bundle (as the case may be) to cover all those appeals. [S 850/2014 wef 01/01/2015] (20)  Consent under paragraph (19) must be given in writing to the Registrar within the time specified in Rule 9(1), as determined with reference to the notice under Rule 5(2) that is first served on any of the consenting parties. [S 850/2014 wef 01/01/2015] (21)  Where consent is given under paragraph (20), any of the consenting parties may apply to the Registrar for directions as to the time by which the single Case, record of appeal or core bundle (as the case may be) must be filed. [S 850/2014 wef 01/01/2015] (22)  If there is no application for directions under paragraph (21), the single Case, record of appeal or core bundle (as the case may be) must be filed within the time specified in Rule 9(1), as determined with reference to the notice under Rule 5(2) that is first served on any of the consenting parties. [S 850/2014 wef 01/01/2015] (23)  Except with the leave of the Court of Appeal, a party cannot file any bundle of documents for an appeal before the Court of Appeal, other than — (a) the core bundle; (b) the Respondent’s supplemental core bundle; or (c) the Appellant’s supplemental core bundle.

"text": "Basis of taxation (O. 59, r. 27) 27.—(1)  Subject to the other provisions of these Rules, the amount of costs which any party shall be entitled to recover is the amount allowed after taxation on the standard basis where — (a) an order is made that the costs of one party to proceedings be paid by another party to those proceedings; (b) an order is made for the payment of costs out of any fund; or (c) no order for costs is required, unless it appears to the Court to be appropriate to order costs to be taxed on the indemnity basis. (2)  On a taxation of costs on the standard basis, there shall be allowed a reasonable amount in respect of all costs reasonably incurred and any doubts which the Registrar may have as to whether the costs were reasonably incurred or were reasonable in amount shall be resolved in favour of the paying party; and in these Rules, the term “the standard basis”, in relation to the taxation of costs, shall be construed accordingly. (3)  On a taxation on the indemnity basis, all costs shall be allowed except in so far as they are of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred and any doubts which the Registrar may have as to whether the costs were reasonably incurred or were reasonable in amount shall be resolved in favour of the receiving party; and in these Rules, the term “the indemnity basis”, in relation to the taxation of costs, shall be construed accordingly. (4)  Where the Court makes an order for costs without indicating the basis of taxation or an order that costs be taxed on any basis other than the standard basis or the indemnity basis, the costs shall be taxed on the standard basis. (5)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) to (4), if any action is brought in the High Court, which would have been within the jurisdiction of a State Court, the plaintiff shall not be entitled to any more costs than he would have been entitled to if the proceedings had been brought in a State Court, unless in any such action a Judge certifies that there was sufficient reason for bringing the action in the High Court."

(3)  In paragraph (2), references to the client shall be construed — (a) if the client at the material time lacked capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act (Cap. 177A) in relation to matters concerning his property and affairs and was represented by a person acting as litigation representative3, as references to that person acting, where necessary, with the authority of the Court; and (b) if the client was at the material time a minor and represented by a person acting as litigation representative3, as references to that person. (4)  The delivery of a bill of costs by a solicitor to his client shall not preclude the solicitor from presenting a bill for a larger amount or otherwise for taxation, if taxation is ordered by the Court or is consented to by the solicitor and his client.

(2)  Before a warrant to arrest any property is issued, a party applying for it must — (a) file a warrant in Form 160; and (b) procure a search to be made in the record of caveats for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is a caveat against arrest in force with respect to that property. (3)  A warrant of arrest shall not be issued until the party applying for the warrant has filed an affidavit made by him or his agent containing the particulars required by paragraphs (6) and (7); however, the Court may, if it thinks fit, allow the warrant to issue notwithstanding that the affidavit does not contain all those particulars. (4)  Except with the leave of the Court a warrant of arrest shall not be issued in an action in rem against a foreign ship belonging to a port of a state having a consulate in Singapore, being an action for possession of the ship or for wages, until notice that the action has been begun has been sent to the consul. (5)  Issue of a warrant of arrest takes place upon its being sealed by an officer of the registry. (6)  Every affidavit required by paragraph (3) must state — (a) the name, address and occupation of the applicant for the warrant; (b) the nature of the claim or counterclaim in respect of which the warrant is required and that it has not been satisfied and, if it arises in connection with a ship the name of that ship; and (c) the nature of the property to be arrested and, if the property is a ship, the name of the ship and the port of her registry. (7)  Every affidavit in an action in rem brought against a ship by virtue of section 4(4) of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap. 123), must state — (a) the name of the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in personam (“the relevant person”); (b) that the relevant person was when the cause of action arose the owner or charterer of, or in possession or in control of, the ship in connection with which the claim arose; (c) that at the time of the issue of the writ the relevant person was either the beneficial owner of all the shares in the ship in respect of which the warrant is required or the charterer of that ship under a charter by demise; and (d) in the case of a claim for possession of a ship or for wages, the nationality of the ship in respect of which the warrant is required, and that the notice (if any) required by paragraph (4) has been sent."

(3)  The advertisement to be required under paragraph (2)(a) shall, unless for special reasons the Registrar or Judge thinks fit otherwise to provide, be a single advertisement in each of 3 newspapers specified in the decree, identifying the action, the casualty and the relation of the plaintiff thereto (whether as owner of a ship involved in the casualty or otherwise, as the case may be), stating that the decree has been made and specifying the amounts fixed thereby as the limits of the plaintiff’s liability and the time allowed thereby for the entering of appearances, the filing of claims and the taking out of summonses to set the decree aside. The plaintiff must within the time fixed under paragraph (2)(b) file in the Registry a copy of each newspaper in which the advertisement required under paragraph (2)(a) appears. (4)  The time to be allowed under paragraph (2)(b) shall, unless for special reasons the Registrar or Judge thinks fit otherwise to provide, be not less than 2 months from the latest date allowed for the appearance of the advertisements; and after the expiration of the time so allowed, no appearance may be entered, claim filed or summons taken out to set aside the decree except with the leave of the Registrar or, on an appeal, of the Judge. (5)  Except as aforesaid, any decree limiting the plaintiff’s liability (whether made by a Registrar or on the trial of the action) may make any such provision as is authorised by the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap. 179)."
