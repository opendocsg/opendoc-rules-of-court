**1.**—(1)  If, when the trial of an action is called on, neither party appears, the Judge may dismiss the action or make any other order as he thinks fit.



(2)  If, when the trial of an action is called on, one party does not appear, the Judge may proceed with the trial of the action or any counterclaim in the absence of that party, or may without trial give judgment or dismiss the action, or make any other order as he thinks fit.

## Judgment, etc., given in absence of party may be set aside (O. 35, r. 2)

**2.**—(1)  Any judgment or order made under Rule 1 may be set aside by the Court on the application of any party on such terms as the Court thinks just.



(2)  Unless the Court otherwise orders, an application under this Rule must be made within 14 days after the date of the judgment or order.

## Adjournment of trial (O. 35, r. 3)

**3.**  The Judge may, if he thinks it expedient in the interest of justice, adjourn a trial for such time, and upon such terms, if any, as he thinks fit.

## Order of speeches (O. 35, r. 4)

**4.**—(1)  The Judge before whom an action is tried may give directions as to the party to begin and the order of speeches at the trial and, subject to any such directions, the party to begin and the order of speeches shall be that provided by this Rule.



(2)  Subject to paragraph (6), the plaintiff shall begin by opening his case.



(3)  If the defendant elects not to adduce evidence, then, whether or not the defendant has in the course of cross-examination of a witness for the plaintiff or otherwise put in a document, the plaintiff may, after the evidence on his behalf has been given, make a second speech closing his case and the defendant shall then state his case.



(4)  If the defendant elects to adduce evidence, he may, after any evidence on behalf of the plaintiff has been given, open his case and, after the evidence on his behalf has been given, make a second speech closing his case, and at the close of the defendant’s case the plaintiff may make a speech in reply.



(5)  Where there are 2 or more defendants who appear separately or are separately represented, then —

>(_a_) if none of them elects to adduce evidence, each of them shall state his case in the order in which his name appears on the record;

>(_b_) if each of them elects to adduce evidence, each of them may open his case and the evidence on behalf of each of them shall be given in the order aforesaid and the speech of each of them closing his case shall be made in that order after the evidence on behalf of all the defendants has been given; and

>(_c_) if some of them elect to adduce evidence and some do not, those who do not shall state their cases in the order aforesaid after the speech of the plaintiff in reply to the other defendants.



(6)  Where the burden of proof of all the issues in the action lies on the defendant or, where there are 2 or more defendants and they appear separately or are separately represented, on one of the defendants, the defendant or that defendant, as the case may be, shall be entitled to begin, and in that case paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) shall have effect in relation to, and as between, him and the plaintiff as if for references to the plaintiff and the defendant there were substituted references to the defendant and the plaintiff respectively.



(7)  Where, as between the plaintiff and any defendant, the party who would, but for this paragraph, be entitled to make the final speech raises any fresh point of law in that speech or cites in that speech any authority not previously cited, the opposite party may make a further speech in reply, but only in relation to that point of law or that authority, as the case may be.

## Death of party before giving of judgment (O. 35, r. 6)

**6.**  Where a party to any action dies after the finding of the issues of fact and before judgment is given, judgment may be given notwithstanding the death, but the foregoing provision shall not be taken as affecting the power of the Judge to make an order under Order 15, Rule 7(2) before giving judgment.
