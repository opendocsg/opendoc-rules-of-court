(2)  On making any payment into Court under this Rule, and on increasing any such payment already made, the defendant must give notice thereof in Form 31 to the plaintiff and every other defendant (if any); and within 3 days after receiving the notice the plaintiff must send the defendant a written acknowledgment of its receipt.



(3)  A defendant may, without leave, give notice of an increase in a payment made under this Rule but, subject to that and without prejudice to paragraph (5), a notice of payment may not be withdrawn or amended without the leave of the Court which may be granted on such terms as may be just.

(5)  Where a single sum of money is paid into Court under this Rule in respect of 2 or more causes of action, then, if it appears to the Court that the plaintiff is embarrassed by the payment, the Court may, subject to paragraph (6), order the defendant to amend the notice of payment so as to specify the sum paid in respect of each cause of action.



(6)  Where a cause of action under section 10 of the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43) and a cause of action under section 20 of that Act are joined in an action, with or without any other cause of action, the causes of action under those sections shall, for the purpose of paragraph (5), be treated as one cause of action.
