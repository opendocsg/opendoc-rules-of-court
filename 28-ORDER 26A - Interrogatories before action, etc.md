# ORDER 26A - Interrogatories before action, etc.

## Interrogatories against other person (O. 26A, r. 1)

**1.**—(1)  An application for an order to administer interrogatories before the commencement of proceedings shall be made by originating summons and the person against whom the order is sought shall be made defendant to the originating summons.



(2)  An application after the commencement of proceedings for an order to administer interrogatories to a person who is not a party to the proceedings shall be made by summons, which must be served on that person personally and on every party to the proceedings.



(3)  The originating summons under paragraph (1) or summons under paragraph (2) shall be supported by an affidavit which must —

>(_a_) in the case of an originating summons under paragraph (1), state the grounds for the application, the material facts pertaining to the intended proceedings and whether the person against whom the order is sought is likely to be party to subsequent proceedings in Court; and

>(_b_) in any case, specify the interrogatories to be administered and show, if practicable by reference to any pleading served or intended to be served in the proceedings that the answers to the interrogatories are relevant to an issue arising or likely to arise out of the claim made or likely to be made in the proceedings or the identity of the likely parties to the proceedings, or both.



(4)  A copy of the supporting affidavit shall be served with the originating summons or summons on every person on whom the originating summons or summons is required to be served.



(5)  An order to administer interrogatories before the commencement of proceedings or to administer interrogatories to a person who is not a party to the proceedings may be made by the Court for the purpose of or with a view to identifying possible parties to any proceedings in such circumstances where the Court thinks it just to make such an order, and on such terms as it thinks just.

## Interrogatories to be ordered only if necessary (O. 26A, r. 2)

**2.**  On the hearing of an application for an order under Rule 1, the Court, if satisfied that interrogatories are not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, may dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an order if and so far as it is of opinion that interrogatories are not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.

## Security for costs (O. 26A, r. 3)

**3.**  An order to administer interrogatories may be made conditional on the applicant’s giving security for the costs of the person against whom it is made or on such other terms, if any, as the Court thinks just.

## Form, objections, failure to comply, etc. (O. 26A, r. 4)

**4.**  Order 26, Rule 2 (except Rule 2(3) thereof), and Rules 4 to 8 (except Rule 5(3)) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to this Order.

## Costs (O. 26A, r. 5)

**5.**  Unless the Court orders otherwise, where an application is made in accordance with this Order, the person against whom the order is sought shall be entitled to his costs of the application, and of complying with any order made thereon on an indemnity basis.
