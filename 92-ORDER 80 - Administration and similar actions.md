## Parties (O. 80, r. 3)

**3.**—(1)  All the personal representatives to which an administration or such an action as is referred to in Rule 2 relates must be parties to the action, and where the action is brought by personal representatives, any of them who does not consent to being joined as a plaintiff must be made a defendant.



(2)  Notwithstanding anything in Order 15, Rule 4(2), and without prejudice to the powers of the Court under that Order, all the persons having a beneficial interest in or claim against the estate or having a beneficial interest under the trust, as the case may be, to which such an action as is mentioned in paragraph (1) relates need not be parties to the action; but the plaintiff may make such of those persons, whether all or any one or more of them, parties as, having regard to the nature of the relief or remedy claimed in the action, he thinks fit.



(3)  Where, in proceedings under a judgment or order given or made in an action for the administration under the direction of the Court of the estate of a deceased person, a claim in respect of a debt or other liability is made against the estate by a person not a party to the action, no party other than the executors or administrators of the estate shall be entitled to appear in any proceedings relating to that claim without the leave of the Court, and the Court may direct or allow any other party to appear either in addition to, or in substitution for, the executors or administrators on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit.

## Grant of relief in action begun by originating summons (O. 80, r. 4)

**4.**  In an administration action or such an action as is referred to in Rule 2, the Court may make any certificate or order and grant any relief to which the plaintiff may be entitled by reason of any breach of trust, wilful default or other misconduct of the defendant notwithstanding that the action was begun by originating summons, but the foregoing provision is without prejudice to the power of the Court to make an order under Order 28, Rule 8 in relation to the action.

## Judgments and orders in administration actions (O. 80, r. 5)

(2)  Where an administration action is brought by a creditor of the estate of a deceased person or by a person claiming to be entitled under a will or on the intestacy of a deceased person or to be beneficially entitled under a trust, and the plaintiff alleges that no or insufficient accounts have been furnished by the personal representatives, as the case may be, then, without prejudice to its other powers, the Court may —

>(_a_) order that proceedings in the action be stayed for a period specified in the order and that the personal representatives, shall within that period furnish the plaintiff with proper accounts; and

>(_b_) if necessary to prevent proceedings by other creditors or by other persons claiming to be entitled as aforesaid, give judgment or make an order for the administration of the estate to which the action relates and include therein an order that no proceedings are to be taken under the judgment or order, or under any particular account or inquiry directed, without the leave of the Judge in person.
