>(_a_) claims against a person not already a party to the action any contribution or indemnity;

>(_b_) claims against such a person any relief or remedy relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the action and substantially the same as some relief or remedy claimed by the plaintiff; or

>(_c_) requires that any question or issue relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the action should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and the defendant but also as between either or both of them and a person not already a party to the action,

>then, subject to paragraph (2), the defendant may, after having entered an appearance if required to do so under these Rules, issue a notice in Form 16 or 17, whichever is appropriate (referred to in this Order as a third party notice), containing a statement of the nature of the claim made against him and, as the case may be, either of the nature and grounds of the claim made by him or of the question or issue required to be determined.



(2)  A defendant to an action may not issue a third party notice without the leave of the Court unless the action was begun by writ and he issues the notice before serving his defence on the plaintiff.



(3)  Where a third party notice is served on the person against whom it is issued, he shall as from the time of service be a party to the action (referred to in this Order as a third party) with the same rights in respect of his defence against any claim made against him in the notice and otherwise as if he had been duly sued in the ordinary way by the defendant by whom the notice is issued.

## Application for leave to issue third party notice (O. 16, r. 2)

**2.**—(1)  An application for leave to issue a third party notice may be made by ex parte summons in Form 18 but the Court may direct the summons to be served.

## Third party directions (O. 16, r. 4)

**4.**—(1)  The defendant who issued a third party notice must, by summons in Form 20 to be served on all the other parties to the action, apply to the Court for directions, except that where the action was begun by writ, such application shall not be made before the third party enters an appearance in Form 10.



(2)  If no summons is served on the third party under paragraph (1), the third party may —

>(_a_) in an action begun by writ, not earlier than 7 days after entering an appearance; or

>(_b_) in an action begun by originating summons, not earlier than 14 days after service of the notice on him,

>by summons in Form 20 to be served on all the other parties to the action, apply to the Court for directions or for an order to set aside the third party notice.



(3)  On an application for directions under this Rule, the Court may —

>(_a_) if the liability of the third party to the defendant who issued the third party notice is established on the hearing, order such judgment as the nature of the case may require to be entered against the third party in favour of the defendant;

>(_b_) order any claim, question or issue stated in the third party notice to be tried in such manner as the Court may direct; or

>(_c_) dismiss the application and terminate the proceedings on the third party notice; and may do so either before or after any judgment in the action has been signed by the plaintiff against the defendant.



(4)  On an application for directions under this Rule, the Court may give the third party leave to defend the action, either alone or jointly with any defendant, upon such terms as may be just, or to appear at the trial or hearing and to take such part therein as may be just, and generally may make such orders and give such directions as appear to the Court proper for having the rights and liabilities of the parties most conveniently determined and enforced and as to the extent to which the third party is to be bound by any judgment or decision in the action.



(5)  Any order made or direction given under this Rule must be in Form 21 and may be varied or rescinded by the Court at any time.

## Default of third party, etc. (O. 16, r. 5)

**5.**—(1)  If a third party who is required by these Rules to enter an appearance does not do so or, having been ordered to serve a defence, fails to do so —

>(_a_) he shall be deemed to admit any claim stated in the third party notice and shall be bound by any judgment (including judgment by consent) or decision in the action in so far as it is relevant to any claim, question or issue stated in that notice; and

>(_b_) the defendant by whom the third party notice was issued may, if judgment in default is given against him in the action, at any time after satisfaction of that judgment and, with the leave of the Court, before satisfaction thereof, enter judgment against the third party in respect of any contribution or indemnity claimed in the notice, and, with the leave of the Court, in respect of any other relief or remedy claimed therein.



(2)  If a third party or the defendant by whom a third party notice was issued makes default in serving any pleading which he is ordered to serve, the Court may, on the application by summons of that defendant or the third party, as the case may be, order such judgment to be entered for the applicant as he is entitled to on the pleadings or may make such other order as may appear to the Court necessary to do justice between the parties.



(3)  The Court may at any time set aside or vary a judgment entered under paragraph (1)(_b_) or paragraph (2) on such terms (if any) as it thinks just.

## Setting aside third party proceedings (O. 16, r. 6)

**6.**  Proceedings on a third party notice may, at any stage of the proceedings, be set aside by the Court.

## Judgment between defendant and third party (O. 16, r. 7)

**7.**—(1)  Where in any action a defendant has served a third party notice, the Court may at or after the trial of the action, or, if the action is decided otherwise than by trial, on an application by summons, order such judgment as the nature of the case may require to be entered for the defendant against the third party or for the third party against the defendant.



(2)  Where in an action judgment is given against a defendant and judgment is given for the defendant against a third party, execution shall not issue against the third party without the leave of the Court until the judgment against the defendant has been satisfied.

## Claims and issues between defendant and some other party (O. 16, r. 8)

**8.**—(1)  Where in any action a defendant —

>(_a_) claims against a person who is already a party to the action any contribution or indemnity;

>(_b_) claims against such a person any relief or remedy relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the action and substantially the same as some relief or remedy claimed by the plaintiff; or

>(_c_) requires that any question or issue relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the action should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and himself but also as between either or both of them and some other person who is already a party to the action,

>then, subject to paragraph (2), the defendant may, after having entered an appearance if required to do so under these Rules, without leave, issue and serve on that person a notice containing a statement of the nature and grounds of his claim or, as the case may be, of the question or issue required to be determined.



(2)  Where a defendant makes such a claim as is mentioned in paragraph (1) and that claim could be made by him by counterclaim in the action, paragraph (1) shall not apply in relation to the claim.



(3)  No appearance to such a notice shall be necessary if the person on whom it is served has entered an appearance in the action or is a plaintiff therein or if the action was begun by originating summons, and the same procedure shall be adopted for the determination between the defendant by whom, and the person on whom, such a notice is served of the claim, question or issue stated in the notice as would be appropriate under this Order if the person served with the notice were a third party and (where, in an action begun by writ, he has entered an appearance in the action or is a plaintiff) had entered an appearance to the notice.



(4)  If no summons under Rule 4(1) is served on the person on whom a notice has been served under this Rule, that person may, not earlier than 14 days after service of the notice on him, by summons in Form 20 to be served on all the other parties to the action, apply to the Court for directions or for an order to set aside the notice.

## Claims by third and subsequent parties (O. 16, r. 9)

**9.**—(1)  Where a defendant has served a third party notice and the third party makes such a claim or requirement as is mentioned in Rule 1 or Rule 8, this Order shall apply, with the modification mentioned in paragraph (2) and any other necessary modifications, as if the third party were a defendant; and similarly where any further person to whom, by virtue of this Rule, this Order applies as if he were a third party makes such a claim or requirement.



(2)  The modification referred to in paragraph (1) is that paragraph (3) shall have effect in relation to the issue of a notice under Rule 1 by a third party in substitution for Rule 1(2).



(3)  A third party may not issue a notice under Rule 1 without the leave of the Court unless the action in question was begun by writ and he issues the notice before the expiration of 14 days after the time limited for appearing to the notice issued against him.

**10.**  \[_Deleted by S 278/93 and S 279/93_\]

## Counterclaim by defendant (O. 16, r. 11)
