<h1 id="order-14---summary-judgment-and-disposal-of-case-on-point-of-law">ORDER 14 - Summary judgment and disposal of case on point of law</h1>

<h2 id="application-by-plaintiff-for-summary-judgment-o-14-r-1">Application by plaintiff for summary judgment (O. 14, r. 1)</h2>

<p><strong>1.</strong>  Where a statement of claim has been served on a defendant and that defendant has served a defence to the statement of claim, the plaintiff may, on the ground that that defendant has no defence to a claim included in the writ, or to a particular part of such a claim, or has no defence to such a claim or part except as to the amount of any damages claimed, apply to the Court for judgment against that defendant.</p>

<h2 id="manner-in-which-application-under-rule-1-must-be-made-o14-r2">Manner in which application under Rule 1 must be made (O. 14, r. 2)</h2>

<p><strong>2.</strong>—(1)  An application under Rule 1 must be made by summons supported by an affidavit or affidavits.</p>

<p>(2)  The summons and the supporting affidavit or affidavits must be filed at the same time, and must be served on the defendant within 3 days from the date of filing.</p>

<p>(3)  The defendant on whom the summons and the supporting affidavit or affidavits have been served may show cause against the plaintiff’s application by affidavit or otherwise to the satisfaction of the Court.</p>

<p>(4)  If the defendant wishes to show cause against the plaintiff’s application by affidavit, he must file and serve his affidavit or affidavits on the plaintiff within 14 days after service of the plaintiff’s summons and affidavit or affidavits.</p>

<p>(5)  The plaintiff must, if he wishes to reply to the defendant’s affidavit or affidavits, file and serve his affidavit or affidavits on the defendant within 14 days after service of the defendant’s affidavit or affidavits.</p>

<p>(6)  No further affidavit shall be received in evidence without the leave of the Court.</p>

<p>(7)  Where a party files or serves an affidavit beyond the period of time specified in this Rule, the Court may make such order as to costs against that party as it considers fit.</p>

<p>(8)  An affidavit or affidavits for the purpose of this Rule must contain all necessary evidence in support of or in opposition (as the case may be) to the claim, or a part of the claim, to which the application relates, and unless the Court otherwise directs, may contain statements of information or belief with the sources and grounds thereof.</p>

<h2 id="judgment-for-plaintiff-o-14-r-3">Judgment for plaintiff (O. 14, r. 3)</h2>

<p><strong>3.</strong>—(1)  Unless on the hearing of an application under Rule 1 either the Court dismisses the application or the defendant satisfies the Court with respect to the claim, or part of a claim, to which the application relates that there is an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried or that there ought for some other reason to be a trial of that claim or part, the Court may give such judgment for the plaintiff against that defendant on that claim or part as may be just having regard to the nature of the remedy or relief claimed.</p>

<p>(2)  The Court may by order, and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be just, stay execution of any judgment given against a defendant under this Rule until after the trial of any counterclaim made or raised by the defendant in the action.</p>

<h2 id="leave-to-defend-o-14-r-4">Leave to defend (O. 14, r. 4)</h2>

<p><strong>4.</strong>—(1)  The Court may give a defendant against whom an application under Rule 1 is made leave to defend the action with respect to the claim, or part of a claim, to which the application relates either unconditionally or on such terms as to giving security or time or mode of trial or otherwise as it thinks fit.</p>

<p>(2)  On the hearing of such an application the Court may order a defendant showing cause or, where that defendant is a body corporate, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer thereof, or any person purporting to act in any such capacity —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) to produce any document; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) if it appears to the Court that there are special circumstances which make it desirable that he should do so, to attend and be examined on oath.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="application-for-summary-judgment-on-counterclaim-o14-r5">Application for summary judgment on counterclaim (O. 14, r. 5)</h2>

<p><strong>5.</strong>—(1)  Where a defendant to an action begun by writ has served a counterclaim on the plaintiff and the plaintiff has served a defence to the counterclaim, the defendant may, on the ground that the plaintiff has no defence to a claim made in the counterclaim, or to a particular part of such a claim, apply to the Court for judgment against the plaintiff on that claim or part.</p>

<p>(2)  Rules 2, 3 and 4 shall apply in relation to an application under this Rule as they apply in relation to an application under Rule 1 but with the following modifications:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) references to the plaintiff and defendant shall be construed as references to the defendant and plaintiff respectively;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) the words “any counterclaim made or raised by the defendant in” in Rule 3(2) shall be omitted; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>c</em>) the reference in Rule 4(1) to the action shall be construed as a reference to the counterclaim to which the application under this Rule relates.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="directions-o-14-r-6">Directions (O. 14, r. 6)</h2>

<p><strong>6.</strong>—(1)  Where the Court —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) orders that a defendant or a plaintiff has leave (whether conditional or unconditional) to defend an action or counterclaim, as the case may be, with respect to a claim or part of a claim;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) gives judgment for a plaintiff or a defendant on a claim or part of a claim but also orders that execution of the judgment be stayed pending the trial of a counterclaim or of the action, as the case may be; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>c</em>) dismisses, or grants leave for the withdrawal of, the application under this Order,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>the Court shall give directions as to the further conduct of the action and Order 25, Rules 2 to 7 shall, with the omission of so much of Rule 7(1) of that Order as requires parties to serve a notice specifying the orders and directions which they require and with any other necessary modifications, apply as if the application under Rule 1 or 5, as the case may be, on which the order was made were a summons for directions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2)  In particular, and if the parties consent, the Court may direct that the claim in question and any other claim in the action be tried by the Registrar under the provisions of these Rules relating to the trial of causes or matters or questions or issues by the Registrar.</p>

<h2 id="costs-o-14-r-7">Costs (O. 14, r. 7)</h2>

<p><strong>7.</strong>—(1)  If, on an application under Rule 1, it appears to the Court that the plaintiff knew that the defendant relied on a contention which would entitle him to unconditional leave to defend, then, the Court may dismiss the application with costs.</p>

<p>(2)  The Court shall have the same power to dismiss an application under Rule 5 as it has under paragraph (1) to dismiss an application under Rule 1, and that paragraph shall apply accordingly with the necessary modifications.</p>

<p>(3)  If the Court dismisses an application under Rule 1 or gives a defendant against whom such an application is made unconditional leave to defend the action with respect to the claim or any part thereof to which the application relates, the Court may make such order as to costs against the plaintiff as it considers fit.</p>

<h2 id="right-to-proceed-with-residue-of-action-or-counterclaim-o14-r8">Right to proceed with residue of action or counterclaim (O. 14, r. 8)</h2>

<p><strong>8.</strong>—(1)  Where on an application under Rule 1 the plaintiff obtains judgment on a claim or part of a claim against any defendant, he may proceed with the action as respects any other claim or as respects the remainder of the claim or against any other defendant.</p>

<p>(2)  Where on an application under Rule 5 a defendant obtains judgment on a claim or part of a claim made in a counterclaim against the plaintiff, he may proceed with the counterclaim as respects any other claim or as respects the remainder of the claim or against any other defendant to the counterclaim.</p>

<h2 id="judgment-for-delivery-up-of-movable-property-o14-r9">Judgment for delivery up of movable property (O. 14, r. 9)</h2>

<p><strong>9.</strong>  Where the claim is for the delivery up of a specific movable property and the Court gives judgment under this Order for the applicant, it shall have the same power to order the party against whom judgment is given to deliver up the property without giving him an option to retain it on paying the assessed value thereof as if the judgment had been given after trial.</p>

<h2 id="relief-against-forfeiture-o-14-r-10">Relief against forfeiture (O. 14, r. 10)</h2>

<p><strong>12.</strong>—(1)  The Court may, upon the application of a party or of its own motion, determine any question of law or construction of any document arising in any cause or matter where it appears to the Court that —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) such question is suitable for determination without a full trial of the action; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) such determination will fully determine (subject only to any possible appeal) the entire cause or matter or any claim or issue therein.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2)  Upon such determination, the Court may dismiss the cause or matter or make such order or judgment as it thinks just.</p>

<p>(3)  The Court shall not determine any question under this Order unless the parties have had an opportunity of being heard on the question.</p>

<h2 id="joinder-of-causes-of-action-o-15-r-1">Joinder of causes of action (O. 15, r. 1)</h2>

<p><strong>1.</strong>—(1)  Subject to Rule 5(1), a plaintiff may in one action claim relief against the same defendant in respect of more than one cause of action —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) if the plaintiff claims, and the defendant is alleged to be liable, in the same capacity in respect of all the causes of action;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) if the plaintiff claims or the defendant is alleged to be liable in the capacity of executor or administrator of an estate in respect of one or more of the causes of action and in his personal capacity but with reference to the same estate in respect of all the others; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>c</em>) with the leave of the Court.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2)  An application for leave under this Rule must be made by ex parte summons supported by affidavit before the issue of the writ or originating summons, as the case may be, and the affidavit must state the grounds of the application.</p>

<h2 id="counterclaim-against-plaintiff-o-15-r-2">Counterclaim against plaintiff (O. 15, r. 2)</h2>

<p><strong>2.</strong>—(1)  Subject to Rule 5(2), a defendant in any action who alleges that he has any claim or is entitled to any relief or remedy against a plaintiff in the action in respect of any matter (whenever and however arising) may, instead of bringing a separate action, make a counterclaim in respect of that matter; and where he does so he must add the counterclaim to his defence.</p>

<p>(2)  Rule 1 shall apply in relation to a counterclaim as if the counterclaim were a separate action and as if the person making the counterclaim were the plaintiff and the person against whom it is made a defendant.</p>

<p>(3)  A counterclaim may be proceeded with notwithstanding that judgment is given for the plaintiff in the action or that the action is stayed, discontinued or dismissed.</p>

<p>(4)  Where a defendant establishes a counterclaim against the claim of the plaintiff and there is a balance in favour of one of the parties, the Court may give judgment for the balance, so, however, that this provision shall not be taken as affecting the Court’s discretion with respect to costs.</p>

<h2 id="counterclaim-against-additional-parties-o-15-r-3">Counterclaim against additional parties (O. 15, r. 3)</h2>

<p><strong>3.</strong>—(1)  Where a defendant to an action who makes a counterclaim against the plaintiff alleges that any other person (whether or not a party to the action) is liable to him along with the plaintiff in respect of the subject-matter of the counterclaim, or claims against such other person any relief relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the action, then, subject to Rule 5(2), he may join that other person as a party against whom the counterclaim is made.</p>

<p>(2)  Where a defendant joins a person as a party against whom he makes a counterclaim, he must add that person’s name to the title of the action and serve on him a copy of the counterclaim; and a person on whom a copy of a counterclaim is served under this paragraph shall, if he is not already a party to the action, become a party to it as from the time of service with the same rights in respect of his defence to the counterclaim and otherwise as if he had been duly sued in the ordinary way by the party making the counterclaim.</p>

<p>(3)  A defendant who is required by paragraph (2) to serve a copy of the counterclaim made by him on any person who before service is already a party to the action must do so within the period within which, by virtue of Order 18, Rule 2, he must serve on the plaintiff the defence to which the counterclaim is added.</p>

<p>(4)  Where by virtue of paragraph (2) a copy of a counterclaim is required to be served on a person who is not already a party to the action, the following provisions of these Rules, namely, Order 10 (except Rule 1(4)), Orders 11 to 13 and Order 70, Rule 3, shall, subject to paragraph (3), apply in relation to the counterclaim and the proceedings arising from it as if —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) the counterclaim were a writ and the proceedings arising from it an action; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) the party making the counterclaim were a plaintiff and the party against whom it is made a defendant in that action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(5)  A copy of a counterclaim required to be served on a person who is not already a party to the action must be endorsed with a notice, in Form 12, addressed to that person —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) stating the effect of Order 12, Rule 1, as applied by paragraph (4); and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) stating that he may enter an appearance in Form 10 and explaining how he may do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="joinder-of-parties-o-15-r-4">Joinder of parties (O. 15, r. 4)</h2>

<p><strong>4.</strong>—(1)  Subject to Rule 5(1), 2 or more persons may be joined together in one action as plaintiffs or as defendants with the leave of the Court or where —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) if separate actions were brought by or against each of them, as the case may be, some common question of law or fact would arise in all the actions; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) all rights to relief claimed in the action (whether they are joint, several or alternative) are in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2)  Where the plaintiff in any action claims any relief to which any other person is entitled jointly with him, all persons so entitled must, subject to the provisions of any written law and unless the Court gives leave to the contrary, be parties to the action and any of them who does not consent to being joined as a plaintiff must, subject to any order made by the Court on an application for leave under this paragraph, be made a defendant.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This paragraph shall not apply to a probate action.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(3)  Where relief is claimed in an action against a defendant who is jointly liable with some other person and also severally liable, that other person need not be made a defendant to the action; but where persons are jointly, but not severally, liable under a contract and relief is claimed against some but not all of those persons in an action in respect of that contract, the Court may, on the application of any defendant to the action, by order stay proceedings in the action until the other persons so liable are added as defendants.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This paragraph shall not apply to any relief claimed under section 15 of the Civil Law Act (Cap. 43).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="court-may-order-separate-trials-etc-o-15-r-5">Court may order separate trials, etc. (O. 15, r. 5)</h2>

<p><strong>5.</strong>—(1)  If claims in respect of 2 or more causes of action are included by a plaintiff in the same action or by a defendant in a counterclaim, or if 2 or more plaintiffs or defendants are parties to the same action, and it appears to the Court that the joinder of causes of action or of parties, as the case may be, may embarrass or delay the trial or is otherwise inconvenient, the Court may order separate trials or make such other order as may be expedient.</p>

<p>(2)  If it appears on the application of any party against whom a counterclaim is made that the subject-matter of the counterclaim ought for any reason to be disposed of by a separate action, the Court may order the counterclaim to be struck out or may order it to be tried separately or make such other order as may be expedient.</p>

<h2 id="misjoinder-and-nonjoinder-of-parties-o-15-r-6">Misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties (O. 15, r. 6)</h2>

<p><strong>6.</strong>—(1)  No cause or matter shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or nonjoinder of any party; and the Court may in any cause or matter determine the issues or questions in dispute so far as they affect the rights and interests of the persons who are parties to the cause or matter.</p>

<p>(2)  Subject to the provisions of this Rule, at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter, the Court may, on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) order any person who has been improperly or unnecessarily made a party or who has for any reason ceased to be a proper or necessary party, to cease to be a party; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) order any of the following persons to be added as a party, namely:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence before the Court is necessary to ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(ii) any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenient to determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(3)  An application by any person for an order under paragraph (2) adding him as a party must, except with the leave of the Court, be supported by an affidavit showing his interest in the matters in dispute in the cause or matter or, as the case may be, the question or issue to be determined as between him and any party to the cause or matter.</p>

<p>(4)  No person shall be added as a plaintiff without his consent signified in writing or in such other manner as may be authorised.</p>

<h2 id="proceedings-against-estates-o-15-r-6a">Proceedings against estates (O. 15, r. 6A)</h2>

<p><strong>6A.</strong>—(1)  Where any person against whom an action would have lain has died but the cause of action survives, the action may, if no grant of probate or administration has been made, be brought against the estate of the deceased.</p>

<p>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), an action brought against “the personal representatives of A.B. deceased” shall be treated, for the purposes of that paragraph, as having been brought against his estate.</p>

<p>(3)  An action purporting to have been commenced against a person shall be treated, if he was dead at its commencement, as having been commenced against his estate in accordance with paragraph (1), whether or not a grant of probate or administration was made before its commencement.</p>

<p>(4)  In any such action as is referred to in paragraph (1) or (3) —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) the plaintiff shall, during the period of validity for service of the writ or originating summons, apply to the Court for an order appointing a person to represent the deceased’s estate for the purpose of the proceedings or, if a grant of probate or administration has been made for an order that the personal representative of the deceased be made a party to the proceedings, and in either case for an order that the proceedings be carried on against the person appointed or, as the case may be, against the personal representative, as if he had been substituted for the estate; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) the Court may, at any stage of the proceedings and on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application, make any such order as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (<em>a</em>) and allow such amendments (if any) to be made and make such other order as the Court thinks necessary in order to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceedings may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3)  Before making an order under this Rule, the Court may, if it thinks fit, refer the matter (except in the case of undue delay in the drawing up of, or in any proceedings under, any order or judgment as to which the Registrar has reported to the Court) to the Registrar for inquiry and report and direct the solicitor in the first place to show cause before him.</p>

<p>(4)  The Court may, if it thinks fit, direct or authorise the Attorney-General to attend and take part in any proceedings or inquiry under this Rule, and may make such order as it thinks fit as to the payment of his costs.</p>

<p>(6)  Where in any proceedings before the Registrar on taxation the solicitor representing any party is guilty of neglect or delay or puts any other party to any unnecessary expense in relation to those proceedings, the Registrar may direct the solicitor to pay costs personally to any of the parties to those proceedings; and where any solicitor fails to leave his bill of costs for taxation within the time fixed by an order of Court or otherwise delays or impedes the taxation, then, unless the Registrar otherwise directs, the solicitor shall not be allowed the fees to which he would otherwise be entitled for drawing his bill of costs and for attending the taxation.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) that the solicitor who presented the bill —</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(iii) pay personally the difference between the amounts of fees mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) above; and</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(iv) pay personally the fee payable for the Registrar’s Certificate.</p>

<h2 id="limitation-action-summons-for-decree-or-directions-o-70-r37">Limitation action: Summons for decree or directions (O. 70, r. 37)</h2>

<p><strong>37.</strong>—(1)  Within 7 days after the entry of appearance by one of the defendants named by their names in the writ, or, if none of them enters an appearance, within 7 days after the time limited for appearing, the plaintiff, without serving a statement of claim, must take out a summons before the Registrar asking for a decree limiting his liability or, in default of such a decree, for directions as to the further proceedings in the action.</p>

<p>(2)  The summons must be supported by an affidavit or affidavits proving —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) the plaintiff’s case in the action; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) if none of the defendants named in the writ by their names has entered an appearance, service of the writ on at least one of the defendants so named.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3)  The affidavit in support of the summons must state —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) the names of all the persons who, to the knowledge of the plaintiff, have claims against him in respect of the casualty to which the action relates, not being defendants to the action who are named in the writ by their names; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) the address of each of those persons, if known to the plaintiff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(4)  The summons and every affidavit in support thereof must, at least 7 clear days before the hearing of the summons, be served on any defendant who has entered an appearance.</p>

<p>(5)  On the hearing of the summons, the Registrar, if it appears to him that it is not disputed that the plaintiff has a right to limit his liability, shall make a decree limiting the plaintiff’s liability and fix the amount to which the liability is to be limited.</p>

<p>(6)  On the hearing of the summons, the Registrar, if it appears to him that any defendant has not sufficient information to enable him to decide whether or not to dispute that the plaintiff has a right to limit his liability, shall give such directions as appear to him to be appropriate for enabling the defendant to obtain such information and shall adjourn the hearing.</p>

<p>(7)  If on the hearing or resumed hearing of the summons the Registrar does not make a decree limiting the plaintiff’s liability, he shall give such directions as to the further proceedings in the action as appear to him to be appropriate including, in particular, a direction requiring the taking out of a summons for directions under Order 25.</p>

<p>(8)  Any defendant who, after the Registrar has given directions under paragraph (7), ceases to dispute the plaintiff’s right to limit his liability must forthwith file a notice to that effect in the Registry, as the case may be, and serve a copy on the plaintiff and on any other defendant who has entered an appearance.</p>

<p>(9)  If every defendant who disputes the plaintiff’s right to limit his liability serves a notice on the plaintiff under paragraph (8), the plaintiff may take out a summons before the Registrar asking for a decree limiting his liability; and paragraphs (4) and (5) shall apply to a summons under this paragraph as they apply to a summons under paragraph (1).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) need not be advertised; but</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) shall only operate to protect the plaintiff in respect of claims by the persons so named or persons claiming through or under them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2)  In any case not falling within paragraph (1), any decree in the action limiting the plaintiff’s liability (whether made by the Registrar or on the trial of the action) —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) shall be advertised by the plaintiff in such manner and within such time as may be provided by the decree; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) shall fix a time within which persons with claims against the plaintiff in respect of the casualty to which the action relates may enter an appearance in the action (if they have not already done so) and file their claims, and, in cases to which Rule 39 applies, take out a summons if they think fit, to set the decree aside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3)  The advertisement to be required under paragraph (2)(<em>a</em>) shall, unless for special reasons the Registrar or Judge thinks fit otherwise to provide, be a single advertisement in each of 3 newspapers specified in the decree, identifying the action, the casualty and the relation of the plaintiff thereto (whether as owner of a ship involved in the casualty or otherwise, as the case may be), stating that the decree has been made and specifying the amounts fixed thereby as the limits of the plaintiff’s liability and the time allowed thereby for the entering of appearances, the filing of claims and the taking out of summonses to set the decree aside.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The plaintiff must within the time fixed under paragraph (2)(<em>b</em>) file in the Registry a copy of each newspaper in which the advertisement required under paragraph (2)(<em>a</em>) appears.</p>

  <p>(<em>a</em>) was not named by his name in the writ as a defendant to the action; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) if so named, neither was served with the writ nor entered an appearance,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>may, within that time, after entering an appearance, take out a summons before the Registrar asking that the decree be set aside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2)  The summons must be supported by an affidavit or affidavits showing that the defendant in question has a bona fide claim against the plaintiff in respect of the casualty in question and that he has sufficient prima facie grounds for the contention that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief given him by the decree.</p>

<p>(3)  The summons and every affidavit in support thereof must, at least 7 clear days before the hearing of the summons, be served on the plaintiff and any defendant who has entered an appearance.</p>

<p>(4)  On the hearing of the summons, the Registrar, if he is satisfied that the defendant in question has a bona fide claim against the plaintiff and sufficient prima facie grounds for the contention that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief given him by the decree, shall set the decree aside and give such directions as to the further proceedings in the action as appear to him to be appropriate including, in particular, a direction requiring the taking out of a summons for directions under Order 25.</p>

<p>(3)  The reference shall be heard on a day appointed by the Registrar and, unless the reference is in a limitation action or the parties to the reference consent to the appointment of a particular day, the appointment must be made by order on an application by summons made by any party to the cause or matter.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<em>c</em>) send to the parties to the reference notice that he has done so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(5)  Where no statement of the grounds of the Registrar’s decision is filed with his decision and no intimation has been given by the Registrar that he intends to file such a statement later, any party to the reference may, within 14 days after the filing of the decision, make a written request to the Registrar to file such a statement.</p>

<div class="amendNote">[S 850/2018 wef 01/01/2019]</div>

<p>(2)  The decision of the Registrar shall be deemed to be given on the date on which it is filed, but unless he or the Judge otherwise directs, the decision shall not be acted upon until the time has elapsed for filing the summons referred to in paragraph (1).</p>

<p>(3)  A direction shall not be given under paragraph (2) without the parties being given an opportunity of being heard, but may, if the Registrar announces his intended decision at the conclusion of the hearing of the reference, be incorporated in his decision as reduced to writing under Rule 41(4).</p>
