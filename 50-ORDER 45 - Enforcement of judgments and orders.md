## Judgment, etc., requiring act to be done: Order fixing time for doing it (O. 45, r. 6)

**6.**—(1)  Notwithstanding that a judgment or order requiring a person to do an act specifies a time within which the act is to be done, the Court shall, without prejudice to Order 3, Rule 4, have power to make an order requiring the act to be done within another time, being such time after service of that order, or such other time as may be specified therein.

>(_b_) in the case of service under paragraph (3), that if the body corporate neglects to obey the order within the time so specified or, if the order is to abstain from doing an act, that if the body corporate disobeys the order, the body corporate is liable to process of execution to compel the body to obey it.



(5)  With the copy of an order required to be served under this Rule, being an order requiring a person to do an act, there must also be served a copy of any order made under Order 3, Rule 4, extending or abridging the time for doing the act and, where the first mentioned order was made under Rule 5(3) or 6, a copy of the previous order requiring the act to be done.



(6)  An order requiring a person to abstain from doing an act may be enforced under Rule 5 notwithstanding that service of a copy of the order has not been effected in accordance with this Rule if the Court is satisfied that, pending such service, the person against whom or against whose property it is sought to enforce the order has had notice thereof either —

>(_a_) by being present when the order was made; or

>(_b_) by being notified of the terms of the order, whether by telephone, telegram or otherwise.
