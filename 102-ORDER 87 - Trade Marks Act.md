(4)  The period prescribed by paragraph (3) may be extended by the Registrar on the application of any party interested and may be so extended although the application is not made until after the expiration of that period, but the foregoing provision shall not be taken to affect the power of the Court under Order 3, Rule 4 to extend that period.

## Proceedings for infringement of registered trade mark: Validity of registration disputed (O. 87, r. 3)

**3.**—(1)  Where in any proceedings a claim is made for relief for infringement of a registered trade mark, the party against whom the claim is made may in his defence put in issue the validity of the registration of that trade mark or may counterclaim for the revocation of the registration or for a declaration that the registration was invalid or for the rectification of the register, or may do all or any of these.



(2)  A party to any such proceedings who in his pleading (whether by way of defence or counterclaim) disputes the validity of the registration of a registered trade mark or seeks an order for the revocation of the registration or a declaration that the registration is invalid or an order for the rectification of the register must serve with the pleading particulars of the objection to the validity of the registration on which he relies.



(3)  The party referred to in paragraph (2) must serve a copy of his pleading (including a copy of the particulars of objection to the validity of the registration) on the Registrar within 7 days of the filing of the pleading in Court, and the Registrar shall be entitled to take part in the proceedings to the extent permitted by the Court but need not serve a defence or other pleading unless ordered to do so by the Court.

(9)  Where, under section 12(5) or 19(8) of the repealed Act, an applicant for trade mark registration becomes entitled and intends to withdraw his application, which is the subject-matter of an appeal, he must give notice of his intention to the Registrar and to every other party to the appeal within one month after the Court has given leave under section 12(5) or 19(8), as the case may be, for further grounds of objection to be taken.

## Respondent’s notice (O. 87, r. 5)

**5.**—(1)  A respondent who, not having appealed from the decision of the Registrar, desires to contend on the appeal that the decision should be varied, either in any event or in the event of the appeal being allowed in whole or in part, must give notice to that effect, specifying the grounds of that contention and the relief which he seeks from the Court.



(2)  A respondent who desires to contend on the appeal that the decision of the Registrar should be affirmed on grounds other than those set out in the grounds of decision must give notice to that effect, specifying the grounds of that contention.
