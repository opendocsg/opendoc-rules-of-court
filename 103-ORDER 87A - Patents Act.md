## Action for infringement (O. 87A, r. 2)

(2)  The plaintiff in such an action must serve with his statement of claim particulars of the infringement relied on, showing which of the claims in the specification of the patent are alleged to be infringed and giving at least one instance of each type of infringement alleged.



(3)  If a defendant in such an action alleges, as a defence to the action, that at the time of the infringement there was in force a contract or licence relating to the patent made by or with the consent of the plaintiff and containing a condition or term void by virtue of section 51 of the Act, he must serve on the plaintiff particulars of the date of, and parties to, each such contract or licence and particulars of each such condition or term.

**3.**—(1)  A party to an action who puts in issue the validity of a patent by way of defence or counterclaim must serve his defence or counterclaim (as the case may be) together with particulars of the objections to the validity of the patent on which he relies within 42 days after service upon him of the statement of claim, provided that he gives prior notice of his intention to put in issue the validity of the patent within 14 days after service upon him of the statement of claim.



(2)  Particulars given pursuant to paragraph (1) must state every ground on which the validity of the patent is put in issue and must include such particulars as will clearly define every issue which it is intended to raise.



(3)  If the grounds stated in the particulars of objections include want of novelty or want of any inventive step, the particulars must state the manner, time and place of every prior publication or user relied upon and, if prior user is alleged, must —

>(_a_) specify the name of every person alleged to have made such user;

>(_b_) state whether such user is alleged to have continued until the priority date of the claim in question or of the invention, as may be appropriate, and, if not, the earliest and latest date on which such user is alleged to have taken place;

>(_c_) contain a description accompanied by drawings, if necessary, sufficient to identify such user; and

>(_d_) if such user relates to machinery or apparatus, state whether the machinery or apparatus is in existence and where it can be inspected.



(4)  If in the case of an existing patent —

>(_a_) one of the grounds stated in the particulars of objections is that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, is not useful; and

>(_b_) it is intended, in connection with that ground, to rely on the fact that an example of the invention which is the subject of any such claim cannot be made to work, either at all or as described in the specification,

>the particulars must state that fact and identify each such claim and must include particulars of each such example, specifying the respects in which it is alleged that it does not work or does not work as described.
