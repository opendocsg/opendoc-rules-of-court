# ORDER 3 - Time

## “Month” means calendar month (O. 3, r. 1)

**1.**  Without prejudice to the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1), in its application to these Rules, the word “month”, where it occurs in any judgment, order, direction or other document forming part of any proceedings in Court, means a calendar month unless the context otherwise requires.

## Reckoning periods of time (O. 3, r. 2)

**2.**—(1)  Any period of time fixed by these Rules or by any judgment, order or direction for doing any act shall be reckoned in accordance with this Rule.



(2)  Where the act is required to be done within a specified period after or from a specified date, the period begins immediately after that date.



(3)  Where the act is required to be done within or not less than a specified period before a specified date, the period ends immediately before that date.



(4)  Where the act is required to be done a specified number of clear days before or after a specified date, at least that number of days must intervene between the day on which the act is done and that date. 



(5)  Where, apart from this paragraph, the period in question, being a period of 7 days or less, would include a day other than a working day, that day shall be excluded.

## Time expires on a day other than working day (O. 3, r. 3)

**3.**  Where the time prescribed by these Rules, or by any judgment, order or direction, for doing any act expires on a day other than a working day, the act shall be in time if done on the next working day.

## Extension, etc., of time (O. 3, r. 4)

**4.**—(1)  The Court may, on such terms as it thinks just, by order extend or abridge the period within which a person is required or authorised by these Rules or by any judgment, order or direction, to do any act in any proceedings.



(2)  The Court may extend any such period as is referred to in paragraph (1) although the application for extension is not made until after the expiration of that period.



(3)  The period within which a person is required by these Rules, or by any order or direction, to serve, file or amend any pleading or other document may be extended by consent (given in writing) without an order of the Court being made for that purpose, unless the Court specifies otherwise.



(4)  In this Rule, references to the Court shall be construed as including references to the Court of Appeal.



(5)  Paragraph (3) shall not apply to the period within which any action or matter is required to be set down for trial or hearing or within which any notice of appeal is required to be filed.
