# ORDER 82 - Debenture holders&#x2019; action: Receiver&#x2019;s register

## Receiver’s register (O. 82, r. 1)

**1.**  Every receiver appointed by the Court in an action to enforce registered debenture or registered debenture stock shall, if so directed by the Court, keep a register of transfers of, and other transmissions of title to, such debentures or stock (referred to in this Order as the receiver’s register).

## Registration of transfers, etc. (O. 82, r. 2)

**2.**—(1)  Where a receiver is required by Rule 1 to keep a receiver’s register, then, on the application of any person entitled to any debentures or debenture stock by virtue of any transfer or other transmission of title, and on production of such evidence of identity and title as the receiver may reasonably require, the receiver shall, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), register the transfer or other transmission of title in that register.



(2)  Before registering a transfer the receiver must, unless the due execution of the transfer is proved by affidavit, send by post to the registered holder of the debentures or debenture stock transferred at his registered address a notice stating —

>(_a_) that an application for the registration of the transfer has been made; and

>(_b_) that the transfer will be registered unless within the period specified in the notice the holder informs the receiver that he objects to the registration, and no transfer shall be registered until the period so specified has elapsed.

>

>>The period to be specified in the notice shall in no case be less than 7 days after a reply from the registered holder would in the ordinary course of post reach the receiver if the holder had replied to the notice on the day following the day when in the ordinary course of post the notice would have been delivered at the place to which it was addressed.



(3)  On registering a transfer or other transmission of title under this Rule the receiver must endorse a memorandum thereof on the debenture or certificate of debenture stock, as the case may be, transferred or transmitted, containing a reference to the action and to the order appointing him receiver.

## Application for rectification of receiver’s register (O. 82, r. 3)

**3.**—(1)  Any person aggrieved by anything done or omission made by a receiver under Rule 2 may apply to the Court for rectification of the receiver’s register, the application to be made by summons in the action in which the receiver was appointed.



(2)  The summons shall in the first instance be served only on the plaintiff or other party having the conduct of the action but the Court may direct the summons or notice of the application to be served on any other person appearing to be interested.



(3)  The Court hearing an application under this Rule may decide any question relating to the title of any person who is a party to the application to have his name entered in or omitted from the receiver’s register and generally may decide any question necessary or expedient to be decided for the rectification of that register.

## Receiver’s register evidence of transfers, etc. (O. 82, r. 4)

**4.**  Any entry made in the receiver’s register, if verified by an affidavit made by the receiver or by such other person as the Court may direct, shall in all proceedings in the action in which the receiver was appointed be evidence of the transfer or transmission of title to which the entry relates and, in particular, shall be accepted as evidence thereof for the purpose of any distribution of assets, notwithstanding that the transfer or transmission has taken place after the making of a certificate in the action certifying the holders of the debentures or debenture stock certificates.

## Proof of title of holder of bearer debenture, etc. (O. 82, r. 5)

**5.**—(1)  This Rule applies in relation to an action to enforce bearer debentures or to enforce debenture stock in respect of which the company has issued debenture stock bearer certificates.



(2)  Notwithstanding that judgment has been given in the action and that a certificate has been made therein certifying the holders of such debentures or certificates as are referred to in paragraph (1), the title of any person claiming to be such a holder shall (in the absence of notice of any defect in the title) be sufficiently proved by the production of the debenture or debenture stock certificates, as the case may be, together with a certificate of identification signed by the person producing the debenture or certificate identifying the debenture or certificate produced and certifying the person giving his name and address who is the holder thereof.



(3)  Where such a debenture or certificate as is referred to in paragraph (1) is produced in the Chambers of the Judge, the solicitor of the plaintiff in the action must cause to be endorsed thereon a notice stating —

>(_a_) that the person whose name and address is specified in the notice (being the person named as the holder of the debenture or certificate in the certificate of identification produced under paragraph (2)) has been recorded in the Chambers of the Judge as the holder of the debenture or debenture stock certificate, as the case may be;

>(_b_) that that person will, on producing the debenture or debenture stock certificate, as the case may be, be entitled to receive payment of any dividend in respect of that debenture or stock unless before payment a new holder proves his title in accordance with paragraph (2); and

>(_c_) that if a new holder neglects to prove his title as aforesaid he may incur additional delay, trouble and expense in obtaining payment.



(4)  The solicitor of the plaintiff in the action must preserve any certificate of identification produced under paragraph (2) and must keep a record of the debentures and debenture stock certificates so produced and of the names and addresses of the persons producing them and of the holders thereof, and, if the Court requires it, must verify the record by affidavit.

## Requirements in connection with payments (O. 82, r. 6)

**6.**—(1)  Where in an action to enforce any debentures or debenture stock an order is made for payment in respect of the debentures or stock, the Accountant-General shall not make a payment in respect of any such debenture or stock unless either there is produced to him the certificate for which paragraph (2) provides or the Court has in the case in question for special reason dispensed with the need for the certificate and directed payment to be made without it.



(2)  For the purpose of obtaining any such payment the debenture or debenture stock certificate must be produced to the solicitor of the plaintiff in the action or to such other person as the Court may direct and that solicitor or person must endorse thereon a memorandum of payment and must make and sign a certificate certifying that the statement set out in the certificate has been endorsed on the debenture or debenture stock certificate, as the case may be, and send the certificate to the Accountant-General.
