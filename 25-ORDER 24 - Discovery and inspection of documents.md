# ORDER 24 - Discovery and inspection of documents

## Order for discovery (O. 24, r. 1)

**1.**—(1)  Subject to this Rule and Rules 2 and 7, the Court may at any time order any party to a cause or matter (whether begun by writ, originating summons or otherwise) to give discovery by making and serving on any other party a list of the documents which are or have been in his possession, custody or power, and may at the same time or subsequently also order him to make and file an affidavit verifying such a list and to serve a copy thereof on the other party.



(2)  The documents which a party to a cause or matter may be ordered to discover under paragraph (1) are as follows:

>(_a_) the documents on which the party relies or will rely; and

>(_b_) the documents which could —

>>(i) adversely affect his own case;

>>(ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or

>>(iii) support another party’s case.



(3)  An order under this Rule may be limited to such documents or classes of documents only, or to only such of the matters in question in the cause or matter, as may be specified in the order.

## Order for determination of issue, etc., before discovery (O. 24, r. 2)

**2.**—(1)  Where on an application for an order under Rule 1 it appears to the Court that any issue or question in the cause or matter should be determined before any discovery of documents is made by the parties, the Court may order that that issue or question be determined first.



(2)  Where in an action begun by writ an order is made under this Rule for the determination of an issue or a question, Order 25, Rules 2 to 7 shall, with the omission of so much of Rule 7(1) of that Order as requires parties to serve a notice specifying the orders and directions which they desire and with any other necessary modifications, apply as if the application on which the order was made were a summons for directions.

## Form of list and affidavit (O. 24, r. 3)

**3.**—(1)  A list of documents made in compliance with an order under Rule 1 must be in Form 37, and must enumerate the documents in a convenient order and as shortly as possible but describing each of them or, in the case of bundles of documents of the same nature, each bundle, sufficiently to enable it to be identified.



(2)  If it is desired to claim that any documents are privileged from production, the claim must be made in the list of documents with a sufficient statement of the grounds of the privilege.



(3)  An affidavit made under Rule 1(1) verifying a list of documents must be in Form 38.

## Defendant entitled to copy of co-defendant’s list (O. 24, r. 4)

**4.**—(1)  A defendant who has pleaded in an action shall be entitled to have a copy of any list of documents served under Rules 1, 2 and 3 on the plaintiff by any other defendant to the action; and a plaintiff against whom a counterclaim is made in an action begun by writ shall be entitled to have a copy of any list of documents served under any of those Rules on the party making the counterclaim by any other defendant to the counterclaim.



(2)  A party required under paragraph (1) to supply a copy of a list of documents must supply it free of charge on a request made by the party entitled to it.



(3)  Where in an action begun by originating summons the Court makes an order under Rule 1 requiring a defendant to the action to serve a list of documents on the plaintiff, it may also order him to supply any other defendant to the action with a copy of that list.



(4)  In this Rule, “list of documents” includes an affidavit verifying a list of documents.

## Order for discovery of particular documents (O. 24, r. 5)

**5.**—(1)  Subject to Rule 7, the Court may at any time, on the application of any party to a cause or matter, make an order requiring any other party to make an affidavit stating whether any document specified or described in the application or any class of document so specified or described is, or has at any time been, in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.



(2)  An order may be made against a party under this Rule notwithstanding that the party may already have made or been required to make a list of documents or an affidavit under Rule 1.



(3)  An application for an order under this Rule must be supported by an affidavit stating the belief of the deponent that the party from whom discovery is sought under this Rule has, or at some time had, in his possession, custody or power, the document, or class of document, specified or described in the application and that it falls within one of the following descriptions:

>(_a_) a document on which the party relies or will rely;

>(_b_) a document which could —

>>(i) adversely affect his own case;

>>(ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or

>>(iii) support another party’s case;

>(_c_) a document which may lead the party seeking discovery of it to a train of inquiry resulting in his obtaining information which may —

>>(i) adversely affect his own case;

>>(ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or

>>(iii) support another party’s case.



(4)  An order under this Rule shall not be made in any cause or matter in respect of any party before an order under Rule 1 has first been obtained in respect of that party, unless, in the opinion of the Court, the order is necessary or desirable.

## Discovery against other person (O. 24, r. 6)

**6.**—(1)  An application for an order for the discovery of documents before the commencement of proceedings shall be made by originating summons and the person against whom the order is sought shall be made defendant to the originating summons.



(2)  An application after the commencement of proceedings for an order for the discovery of documents by a person who is not a party to the proceedings shall be made by summons, which must be served on that person personally and on every party to the proceedings.



(3)  An originating summons under paragraph (1) or a summons under paragraph (2) shall be supported by an affidavit which must —

>(_a_) in the case of an originating summons under paragraph (1), state the grounds for the application, the material facts pertaining to the intended proceedings and whether the person against whom the order is sought is likely to be party to subsequent proceedings in Court; and

>(_b_) in any case, specify or describe the documents in respect of which the order is sought and show, if practicable by reference to any pleading served or intended to be served in the proceedings, that the documents are relevant to an issue arising or likely to arise out of the claim made or likely to be made in the proceedings or the identity of the likely parties to the proceedings, or both, and that the person against whom the order is sought is likely to have or have had them in his possession, custody or power.



(4)  A copy of the supporting affidavit shall be served with the originating summons or summons on every person on whom the originating summons or summons is required to be served.



(5)  An order for the discovery of documents before the commencement of proceedings or for the discovery of documents by a person who is not a party to the proceedings may be made by the Court for the purpose of or with a view to identifying possible parties to any proceedings in such circumstances where the Court thinks it just to make such an order, and on such terms as it thinks just.



(6)  An order for the discovery of documents may —

>(_a_) be made conditional on the applicant’s giving security for the costs of the person against whom it is made or on such other terms, if any, as the Court thinks just; and

>(_b_) require the person against whom the order is made to make an affidavit stating whether the documents specified or described in the order are, or at any time have been, in his possession, custody or power and, if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with them and what has become of them.



(7)  No person shall be compelled by virtue of such an order to produce any document which he could not be compelled to produce —

>(_a_) in the case of an originating summons under paragraph (1), if the subsequent proceedings had already been commenced; and

>(_b_) in the case of a summons under paragraph (2), if he had been served with a subpoena to produce documents<sup>1</sup> at the trial.



(8)  For the purpose of Rules 10 and 11, an application for an order under this Rule shall be treated as a cause or matter between the applicant and the person against whom the order is sought.



(9)  Unless the Court orders otherwise, where an application is made in accordance with this Rule for an order, the person against whom the order is sought shall be entitled to his costs of the application, and of complying with any order made thereon on an indemnity basis.

## Discovery to be ordered only if necessary (O. 24, r. 7)

**7.**  On the hearing of an application for an order under Rule 1, 5 or 6, the Court may, if satisfied that discovery is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an order if and so far as it is of opinion that discovery is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.

## Duty to discover continues throughout proceedings (O. 24, r. 8)

**8.**  After the making of any order under Rule 1 or 5, the party required to give discovery under any such order shall remain under a duty to continue to give discovery of all documents falling within the ambit of such order until the proceedings in which the order was made are concluded.

## Inspection of documents referred to in list (O. 24, r. 9)

**9.**  A party who has served a list of documents on any other party in compliance with an order under Rule 1 must allow the other party to inspect the documents referred to in the list (other than any which he objects to produce) and to take copies thereof and, accordingly, he must when he serves the list on the other party also serve on him a notice in Form 39 stating a time within 7 days after the service thereof at which the documents may be inspected at a place specified in the notice.

## Inspection of documents referred to in pleadings and affidavits (O. 24, r. 10)

**10.**—(1)  Any party to a cause or matter shall be entitled at any time to serve a notice in Form 40 on any other party in whose pleadings or affidavits reference is made to any document requiring him to produce that document for the inspection of the party giving the notice and to permit him to take copies thereof.



(2)  The party on whom a notice is served under paragraph (1) must, within 4 days after service of the notice, serve on the party giving the notice a notice in Form 41 stating a time within 7 days after the service thereof at which the documents, or such of them as he does not object to produce, may be inspected at a place specified in the notice, and stating which (if any) of the documents he objects to produce and on what grounds.

## Order for production for inspection (O. 24, r. 11)

**11.**—(1)  If a party who is required by Rule 9 to serve such a notice as is therein mentioned or who is served with a notice under Rule 10(1) —

>(_a_) fails to serve a notice under Rule 9 or, as the case may be, Rule 10(2);

>(_b_) objects to produce any document for inspection; or

>(_c_) offers inspection at a time or place such that, in the opinion of the Court, it is unreasonable to offer inspection then or, as the case may be, there,

>then, subject to Rule 13(1), the Court may, on the application of the party entitled to inspection, make an order in Form 42 for the production of the documents in question for inspection at such time and place, and in such manner, as it thinks fit.



(2)  Without prejudice to paragraph (1), but subject to Rule 13(1), the Court may, on the application of any party to a cause or matter, order any other party to permit the party applying to inspect any documents in the possession, custody or power of that other party in respect of which discovery has been given under any Rule in this Order or in pursuance of any order made thereunder.



(3)  An application for an order under paragraph (2) must be supported by an affidavit specifying or describing the documents of which inspection is sought and stating the belief of the deponent that they are in the possession, custody or power of the other party and that discovery has been given of them under any Rule in this Order or in pursuance of any order made thereunder.

## Order for production to Court (O. 24, r. 12)

**12.**—(1)  At any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter the Court may, subject to Rule 13(1), order any party to produce to the Court any document in his possession, custody or power that falls within one of the following descriptions:

## Production to be ordered only if necessary, etc. (O. 24, r. 13)

**13.**—(1)  No order for the production of any documents for inspection or to the Court shall be made under any of the foregoing Rules unless the Court is of the opinion that the order is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.



(2)  Where on an application under this Order for the production of any document for inspection or to the Court privilege from such production is claimed or objection is made to such production on any other ground, the Court may inspect the document for the purpose of deciding whether the claim or objection is valid.

## Production of business books (O. 24, r. 14)

**14.**—(1)  Where the production of any business books for inspection is applied for under any of the foregoing Rules, the Court may, instead of ordering the production of the original books for inspection, order a copy of any entries therein to be supplied and verified by an affidavit of some person who has examined the copy with the original books.



(2)  Any such affidavit shall state whether or not there are in the original book any, and, if so what, erasures, interlineations or alterations.



(3)  Notwithstanding that a copy of any entries in any book has been supplied under this Rule, the Court may order production of the book from which the copy was made.

## Document disclosure of which would be injurious to public interest: Saving (O. 24, r. 15)

**15.**  Rules 1 to 14 shall be without prejudice to any rule of law which authorises or requires the withholding of any document on the ground that the disclosure of it would be injurious to the public interest.

## Failure to comply with requirement for discovery, etc. (O. 24, r. 16)

**16.**—(1)  If any party who is required by any Rule in this Order, or by any order made thereunder, to make discovery of documents or to produce any document for the purpose of inspection or any other purpose, fails to comply with any provision of the Rules in this Order, or with any order made thereunder, or both, as the case may be, then, without prejudice to Rule 11(1), in the case of a failure to comply with any such provision, the Court may make such order as it thinks just including, in particular, an order that the action be dismissed or, as the case may be, an order that the defence be struck out and judgment be entered accordingly.



(2)  If any party or person against whom an order for discovery or production of documents is made fails to comply with it, then, without prejudice to paragraph (1), he shall be liable to committal.



(3)  Service on a party’s solicitor of an order for discovery or production of documents made against that party shall be sufficient service to found an application for committal of the party disobeying the order, but the party may show in answer to the application that he had no notice or knowledge of the order.



(4)  A solicitor on whom such an order made against his client is served and who fails, without reasonable excuse, to give notice thereof to his client shall be liable to committal.



(5)  A party who is required by any Rule in this Order, or by any order made thereunder, to make discovery of documents or to produce any document for the purpose of inspection or any other purpose, but who fails to comply with any provision of that Rule or with that order, as the case may be, may not rely on those documents save with the leave of the Court.

## Revocation and variation of orders (O. 24, r. 17)

**17.**  Any order made under this Order (including an order made on appeal) may, on sufficient cause being shown, be revoked or varied by a subsequent order or direction of the Court made or given at or before the trial of the cause or matter in connection with which the original order was made.

(2)  An order under this Rule may be made on such terms, if any, as to staying proceedings in the action or otherwise, as the Court thinks fit.

## Restriction on use of privileged document, inspection of which has been inadvertently allowed (O. 24, r. 19)

**19.**  Where a party inadvertently allows a privileged document to be inspected, the party who inspected it may use it or its contents only if the leave of the Court to do so is first obtained.
