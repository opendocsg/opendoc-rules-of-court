# ORDER 40 - Court expert

## Appointment of expert to report on certain question (O. 40, r. 1)

**1.**—(1)  In any cause or matter in which any question for an expert witness arises, the Court may at any time, on its own motion or on the application of any party, appoint an independent expert or, if more than one such question arises, 2 or more such experts, to inquire and report upon any question of fact or opinion not involving questions of law or of construction.



(1A)  An expert appointed under this Order or under Order 32, Rule 12 shall be referred to as a court expert.



(2)  Any court expert in a cause or matter shall, if possible, be a person agreed between the parties and, failing agreement, shall be nominated by the Court.



(3)  The question to be submitted to the court expert and the instructions (if any) given to him shall, failing agreement between the parties, be settled by the Court.



(4)  In this Rule, “expert”, in relation to any question arising in a cause or matter, means any person who has such knowledge or experience of or in connection with that question that his opinion on it would be admissible in evidence.

## Report of court expert (O. 40, r. 2)

**2.**—(1)  The court expert must send his report to the Court, together with such number of copies thereof as the Court may direct, and the Registrar must send copies of the report to the parties or their solicitors.



(2)  The Court may direct the court expert to make a further or supplemental report.



(3)  Any part of a court expert’s report which is not accepted by all the parties to the cause or matter in which it is made shall be treated as information furnished to the Court and be given such weight as the Court thinks fit.

## Experiments and tests (O. 40, r. 3)

**3.**  If the court expert is of opinion that an experiment or test of any kind (other than one of a trifling character) is necessary to enable him to make a satisfactory report, he shall inform the parties or their solicitors and shall, if possible, make an arrangement with them as to the expenses involved, the persons to attend and other relevant matters; and if the parties are unable to agree on any of those matters, it shall be settled by the Court.

## Cross-examination of court expert (O. 40, r. 4)

**4.**  Any party may, within 14 days after receiving a copy of the court expert’s report, apply to the Court for leave to cross-examine the expert on his report, and on that application the Court shall make an order for the cross-examination of the expert by all the parties either —

<table class="p1_1" style="font-size:13pt" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="p1No">(<em>b</em>)</td><td class="pTxt">before an examiner at such time and place as may be specified in the order.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Remuneration of court expert (O. 40, r. 5)

**5.**—(1)  The remuneration of the court expert shall be fixed by the Court and shall include a fee for his report and a proper sum for each day during which he is required to be present either in Court or before an examiner.



(2)  Without prejudice to any order providing for payment of the court expert’s remuneration as part of the costs of the cause or matter, the parties shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the amount fixed by the Court for his remuneration, but where the appointment of a court expert is opposed, the Court may, as a condition of making the appointment, require the party applying for the appointment to give such security for the remuneration of the expert as the Court thinks fit.

## Calling of expert witnesses (O. 40, r. 6)

**6.**  Where a court expert is appointed in a cause or matter, any party may, on giving to the other parties a reasonable time before the trial notice of his intention to do so, call one expert witness to give evidence on the question reported on by the court expert but no party may call more than one such witness without the leave of the Court, and the Court shall not grant leave unless it considers the circumstances of the case to be exceptional.
