(5)  Where an appellant omits to comply with paragraph (1), the appeal shall be deemed to have been withdrawn, but nothing in this Rule shall be deemed to limit or restrict the powers of extending time conferred upon the High Court.



(5A)  Where an appeal is deemed to have been withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (5) and all the parties to the appeal consent to the payment of any sum lodged in Court as security for the costs of the appeal to the appellant, the appellant shall file the document signifying such consent signed by the parties or by their solicitor, and in such event any sum lodged in Court as security for the costs of the appeal shall be paid out to the appellant.

>(_b_) intends to apply in the course of the hearing for leave to introduce a new point not taken in the Court below,

>this should be stated clearly in the Case, and if the new point referred to in sub-paragraph (_b_) involves the introduction of fresh evidence, this should also be stated clearly in the Case and an application for leave must be made under Rule 11 to adduce the fresh evidence.



(5)  A respondent who, not having appealed from the decision of the Court below, desires to contend on the appeal that the decision of that Court should be varied in the event of an appeal being allowed in whole or in part, or that the decision of that Court should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by that Court, must state so in his Case, specifying the grounds of that contention.



(6)  Except with the leave of the High Court, a respondent shall not be entitled on the hearing of the appeal —

>(_a_) to contend that the decision of the Court below should be varied upon grounds not specified in his Case;

>(_b_) to apply for any relief not so specified; or

>(_c_) to support the decision of the Court below upon any grounds not relied upon by that Court or specified in his Case.



(7)  A Case may be amended at any time with the leave of the High Court.



(8)  Except to such extent as may be necessary to the development of the argument, a Case need not set out or summarise the judgment of the Court below, nor set out statutory provisions, nor contain an account of the proceedings below or of the facts of the case.



(9)  Every Case must conclude with a numbered summary of the reasons upon which the argument is founded, and must bear the name and signature of the solicitor who has prepared the Case or who will appear before the High Court.



(10)  The solicitor of any party, in drafting a Case, should assume that it will be read in conjunction with the documents included in the record of appeal.



(11)  All the appellants may join in one Appellants’ Case, and all the respondents may similarly join in one Respondents’ Case.



(12)  A party whose interest in the appeal is passive (such as a stake‑holder, a trustee or an executor) is not required to file a separate Case but should ensure that his position is explained in one of the Cases filed.



(13)  The filing of a joint Case on behalf of both appellant and respondent may be permitted in special circumstances.



(14)  A party to an appeal shall file together with his Case a bundle of authorities relied on by the Court below as well as other authorities to be relied on at the hearing of the appeal and serve such bundle of authorities on the other party.

(3)  The High Court may in any case where it gives a direction under this Rule —

>(_a_) postpone or adjourn the hearing of the appeal for such period and on such terms as may be just; and

>(_b_) give such judgment and make such order on the appeal as might have been given or made if the persons served in pursuance of the direction had originally been parties.

## Withdrawal of appeal (O. 55D, r. 10)

**10.**—(1)  An appellant may, at any time before his appeal is called on for hearing, file and serve on the parties to the appeal a notice to the effect that he does not intend further to prosecute the appeal.



(2)  If all parties to the appeal consent to the intended withdrawal of the appeal, the appellant must file the document signifying such consent signed by the parties or by their solicitor, and the appeal shall thereupon be deemed to have been withdrawn and shall be struck out of the list of appeals by the Registrar.



(3)  In such event, any sum lodged in Court as security for the costs of the appeal shall be paid out to the appellant.



(4)  If all the parties do not consent to the intended withdrawal of the appeal, the appeal shall remain on the list, and shall come on for the hearing of any issue as to costs or otherwise remaining outstanding between the parties, and for the making of an order as to the disposal of any sum lodged in Court as security for the costs of the appeal.

## General powers of Court (O. 55D, r. 11)

**11.**—(1)  The High Court shall have power to receive further evidence on questions of fact, either by oral examination in the High Court, by affidavit, or by deposition taken before an examiner, but no such further evidence (other than evidence as to matters which have occurred after the date of the decision from which the appeal is brought) may be given except on special grounds.  
<div class="amendNote">[S 850/2018 wef 01/01/2019]</div>

(3)  The powers of the High Court under paragraphs (1) and (2) may be exercised notwithstanding that —

>(_a_) no notice of appeal has been given in respect of any particular part of the decision of the Court below or by any particular party to the proceedings in that Court; or

>(_b_) any ground for allowing the appeal or for affirming or varying the decision of that Court is not specified in any of the Cases filed pursuant to Rule 7 or 9,

>and the High Court may make any order, on such terms as the High Court thinks just, to ensure the determination on the merits of the real question in controversy between the parties.



(4)  The powers of the High Court in respect of an appeal shall not be restricted by reason of any interlocutory order from which there has been no appeal.

## Powers of Court as to new trial (O. 55D, r. 12)

(3)  A new trial may be ordered on any question without interfering with the finding or decision on any other question.



(4)  If it appears to the High Court that any such wrong as is mentioned in paragraph (2) affects part only of the matter in controversy, or one or some only of the parties, the High Court may order a new trial as to that part only, or as to that party or those parties only, and give final judgment as to the remainder.



(5)  In any appeal on the ground that damages awarded are excessive or inadequate, the High Court may, in lieu of ordering a new trial —

>(_a_) substitute for the sum awarded such sum as appears to the High Court to be proper; or

(2)  On an appeal, interest for such time as execution has been delayed by the appeal shall be allowed unless the High Court otherwise orders.

## Extension of time (O. 55D, r. 14)

**14.**  Without prejudice to the power of the High Court under Order 3, Rule 4, to extend the time prescribed by any provision of this Order, the period for filing and serving the notice of appeal under paragraph (1) of Rule 4 may be extended by the Court below on application made before the expiration of that period.

(3)  Where any appeal is dismissed or allowed under paragraph (1) or (2), the party who was absent may apply to the High Court for the rehearing of the appeal and where it is proved that there was sufficient reason for the absence of such party, the High Court may order that the appeal be restored for hearing upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit.

## Expedited appeals (O. 55D, r. 16)
