## No application for Mandatory Order7, etc., without leave (O. 53, r. 1)

**1.**—(1)  An application for a Mandatory Order<sup>7</sup>, Prohibiting Order<sup>9</sup> or Quashing Order<sup>10</sup> (referred to in this paragraph as the principal application) —

>(_a_) may include an application for a declaration; but

>(_b_) shall not be made, unless leave to make the principal application has been granted in accordance with this Rule.



(2)  An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought, and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on.



(3)  The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement and the supporting affidavit not later than the preceding day on the Attorney-General’s Chambers.



(4)  The Judge may, in granting leave, impose such terms as to costs and as to giving security as he thinks fit.



(5)  The grant of leave under this Rule to apply for a Prohibiting Order<sup>9</sup> or a Quashing Order<sup>10</sup> shall, if the Judge so directs, operate as a stay of the proceedings in question until the determination of the application or until the Judge otherwise orders.



(6)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, leave shall not be granted to apply for a Quashing Order<sup>10</sup> to remove any judgment, order, conviction or other proceeding for the purpose of its being quashed, unless the application for leave is made within 3 months after the date of the proceeding or such other period (if any) as may be prescribed by any written law or, except where a period is so prescribed, the delay is accounted for to the satisfaction of the Judge to whom the application for leave is made; and where the proceeding is subject to appeal and a time is limited by law for the bringing of the appeal, the Judge may adjourn the application for leave until the appeal is determined or the time for appealing has expired.

## Mode of applying for Mandatory Order7, etc. (O. 53, r. 2)

**2.**—(1)  When leave has been granted to apply for a Mandatory Order<sup>7</sup>, Prohibiting Order<sup>9</sup> or Quashing Order<sup>10</sup> —

>(_a_) the application for the order and any included application for a declaration must be made by summons to a Court in the originating summons in which leave was obtained; and

(2)  Unless the summons is filed within 14 days after such leave was granted, the leave shall lapse.



(3)  The ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave and the summons filed under paragraph (1) must be served on all persons directly affected, and where it relates to any proceedings in or before a Court, and the object is either to compel the Court or an officer thereof to do any act in relation to the proceedings or to quash them or any order made therein, the said documents must be served on the Registrar, the other parties to the proceedings and, where any objection to the conduct of the Judge is to be made, on the Judge.



(4)  An affidavit giving the names and addresses of, and the places and dates of service on, all persons who have been served with the said documents must be filed before the hearing and, if any person who ought to be served under paragraph (3) has not been served, the affidavit must state that fact and the reason why service has not been effected.



(5)  If on the hearing of the summons filed under paragraph (1) the Court is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with the said documents has not been served, whether or not he is a person who ought to have been served under paragraph (3), the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms (if any) as it may direct in order that the said documents may be served on that person.

## Statements and further affidavits (O. 53, r. 3)

**3.**—(1)  Subject to paragraph (2), no grounds shall be relied upon or any relief sought at the hearing of the summons filed under Rule 2 except the grounds and relief set out in that statement.



(2)  The Court may on the hearing of the summons filed under Rule 2 allow the said statement to be amended, and may allow further affidavits to be used if they deal with new matter arising out of any affidavit of any other party to the application, and where the applicant intends to ask to be allowed to amend his statement or use further affidavits, he must give notice of his intention and of any proposed amendment of his statement to every other party, and must serve a copy of such further affidavits on every other party.



(3)  Every party to the application must serve a copy of the affidavits which he proposes to use at the hearing on every other party.

## Right to be heard in opposition (O. 53, r. 4)

**4.**  On the hearing of any summons filed under Rule 2, any person who desires to be heard in opposition to the summons and appears to the Court to be a proper person to be heard shall be heard notwithstanding that he has not been served with any documents.

## Application for Quashing Order10 (O. 53, r. 5)

**5.**—(1)  In the case of an application for a Quashing Order<sup>10</sup> to remove any proceedings, the applicant may not question the validity of any order, warrant, commitment, conviction, inquisition or record unless before the hearing of the summons filed under Rule 2 he has served a copy thereof verified by affidavit on the Attorney-General, or accounts for his failure to do so to the satisfaction of the Court hearing the summons.



(2)  Where a Quashing Order<sup>10</sup> is made in any such case, the order shall direct that the proceedings shall be quashed forthwith on their removal to the High Court.

## Power of Court to grant relief in addition to Mandatory Order7, etc. (O. 53, r. 7)

(2)  For the purposes of determining whether the Court should grant the applicant any relevant relief under paragraph (1), or where the Court has determined that the applicant should be granted any such relief, the Court may give such directions, whether relating to the conduct of the proceedings or otherwise, as may be necessary for the purposes of making the determination or granting the relief, as the case may be.



(3)  Before the Court grants any relevant relief under paragraph (1), any person who opposes the granting of the relief, and who appears to the Court to be a proper person to be heard, shall be heard.



(4)  In this Rule, “relevant relief” means any liquidated sum, damages, equitable relief or restitution.
