## Personal service on body corporate (O. 62, r. 4)

## Substituted service (O. 62, r. 5)

**5.**—(1)  If, in the case of any document which by virtue of any provision of these Rules is required to be served personally on any person, it appears to the Court that it is impracticable for any reason to serve that document personally on that person, the Court may make an order in Form 136 for substituted service of that document.



(2)  An application for an order for substituted service must be made by summons supported by an affidavit in Form 137 stating the facts on which the application is founded.

## Ordinary service: How effected (O. 62, r. 6)

**6.**—(1)  Service of any document, not being a document which by virtue of any provision of these Rules is required to be served personally, may be effected —

>(_b_) by post;

>(_c_) by FAX in accordance with paragraph (3);

>(_d_) in such other manner as may be agreed between the party serving and the party to be served; or

>(_e_) in such other manner as the Court may direct.



(2)  For the purpose of this Rule, and of section 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1), in its application to this Rule, the proper address of any person on whom a document is to be served in accordance with this Rule shall be the address for service of that person, but if at the time when service is effected that person has no address for service his proper address for the purpose aforesaid shall be —

>(_a_) in any case, the business address of the solicitor (if any) who is acting for him in the proceedings in connection with which service of the document in question is to be effected;

>(_d_) in the case of a body corporate, the registered or principal office of the body.



(3)  Service by FAX may be effected where —

>(_a_) the party serving the document acts by a solicitor;

>(_b_) the party on whom the document is served acts by a solicitor and service is effected by transmission to the business address of such a solicitor;

>(_c_) the solicitor acting for the party on whom the document is served has indicated in writing to the solicitor serving the document that he is willing to accept service by FAX at a specified FAX number and the document is transmitted to that number; and for this purpose the inscription of a FAX number on the writing paper of a solicitor shall not be deemed to indicate that such a solicitor is willing to accept service by FAX at that number in accordance with this paragraph; and

>(_d_) within 3 days after the day of service by FAX the solicitor acting for the party serving the document serves a copy of it on the solicitor acting for the other party by any of the other methods of service set out in paragraph (1), and if he fails to do so, the document shall be deemed never to have been served by FAX.
