## Warrant of arrest (O. 70, r. 4)

**4.**—(1)  In an action _in rem_ the plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, may after the issue of the writ in the action and subject to the provisions of this Rule, apply for a warrant in Form 160 for the arrest of the property against which the action or any counterclaim in the action is brought.



(2)  Before a warrant to arrest any property is issued, a party applying for it must —

>(_b_) procure a search to be made in the record of caveats for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is a caveat against arrest in force with respect to that property.



(3)  A warrant of arrest shall not be issued until the party applying for the warrant has filed an affidavit made by him or his agent containing the particulars required by paragraphs (6) and (7); however, the Court may, if it thinks fit, allow the warrant to issue notwithstanding that the affidavit does not contain all those particulars.



(4)  Except with the leave of the Court a warrant of arrest shall not be issued in an action _in rem_ against a foreign ship belonging to a port of a state having a consulate in Singapore, being an action for possession of the ship or for wages, until notice that the action has been begun has been sent to the consul.

(6)  Every affidavit required by paragraph (3) must state —

>(_a_) the name, address and occupation of the applicant for the warrant;

>(_b_) the nature of the claim or counterclaim in respect of which the warrant is required and that it has not been satisfied and, if it arises in connection with a ship the name of that ship; and

<div class="amendNote">[S 51/2018 wef 01/02/2018]</div>

**6.**  Where any property with respect to which a caveat against arrest is in force is arrested in pursuance of a warrant of arrest, the party at whose instance the caveat was entered may apply to the Court by summons for an order under this Rule and, on the hearing of the application, the Court, unless it is satisfied that the party procuring the arrest of the property had a good and sufficient reason for so doing, may by order discharge the warrant and may also order the last-mentioned party to pay to the applicant damages in respect of the loss suffered by the applicant as a result of the arrest.

(3)  Part Two of the preliminary act shall be deemed to be the pleading of the person filing the preliminary act (in the case of the plaintiff his statement of claim and in the case of the defendant his defence and, where appropriate, his counterclaim) and the provisions of these Rules relating to pleadings shall apply to it save insofar as this Rule and Rule 19 provide otherwise.

(6)  A plaintiff must serve notice of filing his preliminary act on every defendant who has entered an appearance within 3 days of the service of the memorandum of appearance or upon filing his preliminary act, whichever is the later.

(7)  Any party may inspect and bespeak a copy of the preliminary act of any other party upon filing in the registry a consent signed by that other party or his solicitor.

>(_b_) if neither a reply nor a defence to counterclaim is served, at the expiration of 7 days after the last preliminary act in the action was served pursuant to paragraph (9).



(9)  Within 14 days after the last preliminary act in the action is filed, each party must serve on every other party a copy of his preliminary act.



(10)  At any time after all preliminary acts have been filed any party may apply to the Court for an order that —

(11)  When an order is made under paragraph (10), the claim or claims concerned shall be treated as referred for assessment and Rules 40 and 41 shall apply unless the Registrar otherwise directs.

## Failure to file preliminary act: Proceedings against party in default (O. 70, r. 18)

**18.**—(1)  Where in such an action as is referred to in Rule 17(1) the plaintiff fails to file a preliminary act within the prescribed period, any defendant who has filed such an act may apply to the Court by summons for an order to dismiss the action, and the Court may by order dismiss the action or make such other order on such terms as it thinks just.



(2)  Where in such an action, being an action _in personam_, a defendant fails to file a preliminary act within the prescribed period, Order 19, Rules 2 and 3 shall apply as if the defendant’s failure to file the preliminary act within that period were a failure by him to serve a defence on the plaintiff within the period fixed by these Rules for service thereof, and the plaintiff, if he has filed a preliminary act may, subject to Order 73, Rule 7, accordingly enter judgment against that defendant in accordance with the said Rule 2 or 3, as the circumstances of the case require.



(3)  Where in such an action, being an action _in rem_, a defendant fails to file a preliminary act within the prescribed period, the plaintiff, if he has filed such an act, may apply to the Court by summons for judgment against that defendant, and it shall not be necessary for the plaintiff to file or serve a statement of claim or an affidavit before the hearing of the summons.



(4)  On the hearing of a summons under paragraph (3), the Court may make such order as it thinks just, and where the defendant does not appear on the hearing and the Court is of the opinion that judgment should be given for the plaintiff provided he proves his case, it shall order the plaintiff’s preliminary act to be opened and require the plaintiff to satisfy the Court that his claim is well-founded. The plaintiff’s evidence may, unless the Court otherwise orders, be given by affidavit without any order or direction in that behalf.



(5)  Where the plaintiff in accordance with a requirement under paragraph (4) satisfies the Court that his claim is well-founded, the Court may give judgment for the claim with or without a reference to the Registrar and may at the same time order the property against which the action is brought to be appraised and sold and the proceeds to be paid into Court or make such order as it thinks just.



(6)  The Court may, on such terms as it thinks just, set aside any judgment entered in pursuance of this Rule.



(7)  In this Rule, references to the prescribed period shall be construed as references to the period within which by virtue of Rule 17(2) or of any order of the Court the plaintiff or defendant, as the context of the reference requires, is required to file a preliminary act.

## Special provisions relating to collision, etc., actions (O. 70, r. 19)

(2)  Subject to paragraph (3), in any such action Order 18, Rule 13(3) shall not apply to any allegation of fact made in —

>(_a_) a statement of claim contained in Part Two of a preliminary act; or

>(_b_) a counterclaim (whether contained in Part Two of a preliminary act or not),

>and notwithstanding Order 18, Rule 14(3), but without prejudice to the other provisions of that Rule, there is an implied joinder of issue on the statement of claim or counterclaim.



(3)  Paragraph (2) does not apply to a counterclaim if the plaintiff has served a defence to counterclaim pursuant to leave given under paragraph (1).



(4)  Every party to an action mentioned in Rule 3(1) must give discovery of any electronic track data that is or has been in the possession, custody or power of that party, by making and serving on every other party a list of all such electronic track data, and by making and filing an affidavit verifying that list and serving a copy of that affidavit on every other party —

>(_a_) in any case where the defendant disputes the jurisdiction of the Court by making an application under Order 12, Rule 7(1), within 21 days after the disposal of that application; or
