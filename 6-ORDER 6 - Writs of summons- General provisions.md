(2A)  Where the Court is satisfied on an application under paragraph (2) that, despite the making of reasonable efforts, it may not be possible to serve a writ within 6 months, the Court may, if it thinks fit, extend the validity of the writ for such period, not exceeding 12 months at any one time, as the Court may specify.



(3)  Before a writ, the validity of which has been extended under this Rule, is served, it must be marked with an official stamp in Form 3 showing the period from which the validity of the writ has been so extended.
